     * phase the calling thread held -- so a thread carrying a stale number
     * could walk it BACKWARDS:
     *   phase 5: A touches -> marker=5, count=1
     *            B (still holding 4) touches -> marker=4     rewound
     *            A touches again -> 4 != 5 -> count=2        counted TWICE
     * An inflated activePhases makes the component look busier than it was, so
     * its idle residency comes out too low and it is credited LESS gating
     * saving than it earned. The old comment claimed "a lost race undercounts
     * one phase, negligible" -- the real failure was over-counting, by an
     * amount that depends on thread interleaving.
     *
     * SCOPE, checked before changing it: cores hold their own tracker
     * (core.h pgAct) and cannot race; only the five SHARED trackers are
     * exposed -- anyCore, sharedCache, noc, hostMC, devMC[] -- which are
     * exactly the ones the reported residencies come from. numPhases advances
     * inside the scheduler's BARRIER callback, so threads agree on the phase
     * for essentially all of it; the stale window is a few instructions.
     *
     * TRADE-OFF: refusing to rewind DROPS a lagging thread's touch of an older
     * phase. The barrier has already left that phase, so another thread has
     * almost certainly counted it; where it has not, the result is a bounded
     * UNDER-count, which under-credits gating rather than over-crediting it.
     *
     * NOT BOUGHT: reproducibility. Which thread wins the CAS still depends on
     * interleaving, so the count is bounded and never inflated, not identical
     * run to run. Per-thread trackers would give that, at the cost of deciding

/* 1.11.40 (audit E17, measurement pass): INTER-EVENT GAP HISTOGRAM.
 *
 * PhaseActivity above answers "was this component busy in this phase?" at
 * 10000-cycle granularity -- 20 us at the 500 MHz device clock, roughly 2000x
 * coarser than the events power gating actually exploits (DRAM power-down exit
 * tXP ~10 ns; logic clock gating is cycle-scale). On our corpus that makes
 * every component read 100% busy and the gating model report nothing.
 *
 * Before redesigning the residency model we measure what is there. This
 * records, per component, the distribution of gaps between consecutive events
 * in log2-cycle buckets: how MANY gaps of each size, and how many CYCLES sit
 * in them. The second is the one that matters -- a gating scheme can only
 * recover time, and only from gaps longer than its wake penalty.
 *
 * 1.11.51 made this LOAD-BEARING: gapPowerDownResidency() reads it back to
 * weight DRAM background power, so it is no longer instrumentation only and
 * the two notes below were corrected accordingly (audit F006).
 *
 * Concurrency follows the E14 lesson: lastCycle never rewinds, and a thread
 * that loses the CAS drops its sample rather than retrying.
 *
 * 1.11.54 (audit F001): THE DIRECTION OF THAT BIAS WAS STATED BACKWARDS. The
 * old note claimed dropping "biases toward FEWER recorded gaps, never toward
 * larger ones, so it cannot manufacture gating opportunity". It does exactly
 * that. A lost CAS does not shrink a gap -- it MERGES two: for arrivals
 * t1 < t2 < t3 delivered out of order, the code records one gap of (t3-t1)
 * where the truth is (t2-t1) and (t3-t2). Under cyclesInGapsOver(thresh) one
 * gap G yields G-thresh while two gaps summing to G yield G-2*thresh, or 0
 * when each falls below the threshold. Merging therefore OVER-states usable
 * idle, inflating the power-down residency and LOWERING reported DRAM
 * background power. The run prints events/samples/dropped so the exposure is
 * bounded and visible; the fix for the bias itself would be a retry loop,
 * which is deliberately not taken here (E14: a retry under contention is how
 * the phase counters became irreproducible). */
