         *
         * Here the two are one locked pass, and it reports ADDRESSES rather
         * than a count: a dirty line is resident at every level of an
         * inclusive hierarchy, so the caller unions the addresses across all
         * caches and gets the number of DISTINCT lines a writeback flush must
         * move. That is the quantity, and it does not depend on any inclusion
         * or silent-upgrade argument holding.
         *
         * Returns the number of lines THIS cache transitioned M -> E, which
         * is the per-level sum and is legitimately larger than the distinct
         * count -- the flush log prints both, labelled.
         *
         * 1.11.60 (audit round 4, D004): VIRTUAL, because cleaning the tag
         * array is not the whole job on a cache that also owns an L0 filter.
         * FilterCache::store() can return a hit without ever calling
         * Cache::access, so an M -> E clean that touches only the array
         * leaves the filter advertising write permission the line no longer
         * has, and the next store never re-establishes M. The registry the
         * flush walks holds Cache*, so the override only runs if the call
         * dispatches -- it did not, and nothing said so. See
         * FilterCache::flushDirtyLines for the mechanism and the bound. */
