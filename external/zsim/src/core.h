/* 1.8.7 co-sim MPI post-ROI protocol-tail RECEIPT, indexed by GLOBAL CORE INDEX
 * (== ALUCore::srcId_ == the plugin's cid). Kept in a FIXED file-scope array
 * rather than a Core member: adding a field to Core changes every core object's
 * size and shifts heap layout, which perturbs the contention sim's
 * address-ordered tie-breaking. Written by the plugin's
 * recordProtocolTailStats() (co-sim MPI only; stays 0 otherwise) and read by the
 * per-PE 'protocolTail' LambdaStat in ALUCore::initStats. Never alters 'cycles'.
 *
 * 1.11.20 (user decision D14) -- THE GUARANTEE THIS BUYS, STATED HONESTLY.
 * The original comment claimed the BSS array preserved bit-identity "vs the
 * 1.6/1.8.6 baseline", i.e. ACROSS versions. It does not, and 1.11.10 proved
 * it: adding pgAct/mix members to Core for power gating changed the layout
 * anyway. What we actually provide, and what every gate actually asserts:
 *
 *   SAME BINARY + same config          -> bit-identical, always.
 *   DIFFERENT BUILD of the same source -> may drift a few cycles.
 *
 * Measured: identical 1.11.15 source built in two trees gave 10164688 vs
 * 10164694 cycles on the deterministic 1-PE cell -- a 6-cycle cross-binary
 * drift with no source difference at all. Gates therefore always compare a
 * within-build NEW/REF pair, which is existing practice, now written down.
 *
 * Restoring the strict no-Core-members rule was considered and rejected: by
 * the measurement above it would NOT deliver cross-version bit-identity, and
 * it would churn all five core types to buy nothing. The array stays because
 * it is still the right place for a receipt; the overclaim is what changed. */
