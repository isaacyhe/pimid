/* Extends Cache with an L0 direct-mapped cache, optimized to hell for hits
 *
 * L1 lookups are dominated by several kinds of overhead (grab the cache locks,
 * several virtual functions for the replacement policy, etc.). This
 * specialization of Cache solves these issues by having a filter array that
 * holds the most recently used line in each set. Accesses check the filter array,
 * and then go through the normal access path. Because there is one line per set,
 * it is fine to do this without grabbing a lock.

        /* 1.11.60 (audit round 4, D004): THE M -> E CLEAN HAS TO DROP THE L0
         * WRITE FILTER, or a store after the flush never re-dirties the line.
         *
         * store() above returns at the fGETXHit line WITHOUT calling
         * Cache::access whenever the line is the filter's current wrAddr, so
         * it never reaches MESIBottomCC::processAccess and never puts the line
         * back in M. Cache::flushDirtyLines drives the line M -> E in the tag
         * array and, until now, left wrAddr pointing straight at it: from that
         * instant the line was dirty in the guest and clean in the model. The
         * next flush did not count it, and when it was finally evicted
         * processEviction sent PUTS instead of PUTX, so its bytes were neither
         * written back nor charged. Only invalidate() and contextSwitch()
         * cleared the filter, and the flush called neither.
         *
         * Why it was invisible: the loss is bounded by the filter, numSets
         * lines per host L1D per flush -- 64 lines, 4 KB, at the shipped
         * 32 KB / 8-way / 64 B host L1D -- and no counter contradicts it. The
         * flush footprint is the only place it surfaces, and it surfaces as a
         * slightly SMALLER number, which is the direction a reader already
         * expects a repeated flush to trend. It grows with numSets and with
         * the number of flushes, and the 1.11.57 redesign reasoned explicitly
         * about zsim's silent E -> M upgrade inside the cache while never
         * mentioning the level above it.
         *
         * Only wrAddr is dropped, with invalidate()'s own -1L idiom. The line
         * is still VALID (E) after the clean, so read hits stay correct; a
         * store now misses the filter, goes through replace() -> GETX, and
         * that is the path that re-establishes M. Cost is at most one extra
         * GETX per set per flush, and replace() leaves availCycle alone when
         * the address is unchanged (oldAddr == vLineAddr), so the re-dirtying
         * store keeps exactly the timing a filtered store hit had.
         *
         * Lock discipline: nothing is added to load() or store(); the fast
         * path is untouched. Cache::flushDirtyLines takes and RELEASES the cc
         * lock before we reach filterLock, so we never hold both and cannot
         * invert replace()'s filterLock -> cc-lock order. Holding filterLock
         * across the clear is what closes the remaining race -- a replace()
         * that has already upgraded the line to M but has not yet published
         * wrAddr would otherwise re-open the identical hole behind us. */
