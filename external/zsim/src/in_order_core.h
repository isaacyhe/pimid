/* Genuine in-order pipeline PE core.
 *
 * Historically this core modeled IPC=1 (curCycle += bblInstrs) plus blocking
 * memory latency and a CoreRecorder weave for cross-PE contention -- which made
 * it numerically identical to SimpleCore whenever there was no contention
 * ("in-order in name only"). This version consumes the same x86-decoded DynUop
 * stream the OOO core uses (BblInfo->oooBbl, populated by the plugin's
 * x86_decoder.h when an in-order OR out-of-order core is present) and runs a
 * real in-order scoreboard:
 *
 *   - uops issue in STRICT PROGRAM ORDER (the defining in-order property);
 *   - a per-physical-register ready-cycle scoreboard stalls issue on RAW
 *     hazards (a uop cannot issue until its source registers are ready);
 *   - up to issueWidth INDEPENDENT uops may issue in one cycle, but the
 *     front-end STOPS at the first uop that cannot issue (no reordering);
 *   - functional-unit port contention is modeled from the decoder port masks;
 *   - loads/stores go through the l1d cache path; a load's destination-register
 *     readiness is gated on the returned latency (load-use stall), and memory
 *     accesses are serialized (blocking L1) which also preserves the
 *     CoreRecorder weave invariant;
 *   - scoreboard state (register ready cycles, port free cycles, issue slot
 *     cursor) CARRIES ACROSS BBL boundaries: a trailing load's completion only
 *     stalls uops that actually depend on it, so independent work in the next
 *     basic block overlaps with it (an in-order front-end flows across basic
 *     blocks; only true dependencies and issue/port limits stall). The pipeline
 *     IS drained (curCycle advanced to the newest outstanding completion) at
 *     points where the overlap is not architecturally meaningful: a branch
 *     MISPREDICT (the flush empties the front-end; correctly-predicted and
 *     fall-through boundaries do NOT drain), and scheduler boundaries --
 *     join/leave, the bound->weave transitions (cSimStart/cSimEnd, so the
 *     CoreRecorder taper covers all outstanding latency), and contextSwitch.
 *
 * The CoreRecorder cross-PE contention weave is layered on top unchanged.
 *
 * NOTE on hit-under-miss (non-blocking L1): intentionally NOT modeled. The
 * CoreRecorder event chain requires each recorded access to start at or after
 * the previous response (CoreRecorder::recordAccess asserts
 * startCycle >= prevRespCycle and links events serially), and FilterCache has
 * no side-effect-free probe to know whether an access hits before issuing it,
 * so a second access cannot be safely started under an outstanding miss.
 * Supporting it would need an OOOCoreRecorder-style multi-outstanding weave
 * recorder. Memory therefore stays serialized via memRespCycle.
 *
 * Escape hatch: PIMID_INORDER_NODECODE=1 restores the exact legacy IPC=1
 * immediate-processing path (byte-identical A/B baseline). A BBL with no decoded
 * uops falls back to a per-BBL synthetic 1-CPI path that still drains buffered
 * loads/stores through the cache so memory/NoC traffic never desyncs.
 *
 * Branch mispredictions: the plugin resolves each TB-terminating conditional
 * branch's real direction (from the next TB's address) and feeds it via
 * BranchFunc, exactly as for the OOO core. The in-order core runs the SAME
 * BranchPredictorPAg<11,18,14> predictor as OOOCore; on a mispredict it charges
 * a fixed front-end flush/refill bubble (default 7 cycles ~= the OOO model's
 * fetch-to-issue depth, ISSUE_STAGE; typical of short in-order pipelines such
 * as Cortex-A53's ~8-cycle mispredict penalty). Overridable via
 * PIMID_INORDER_MISPRED_PENALTY; disable the whole feed with
 * PIMID_INORDER_NOBRANCH=1 (mirrors PIMID_OOO_NOBRANCH).
