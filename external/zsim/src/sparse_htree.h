/* sparse_htree.h -- SHARED, deterministic sparse placement-driven DRAM H-tree.
 *
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (invariant #2): the topology emitter (src/main.cpp) and
 * the PE-MI routing (pe_memory_interface.h) both call buildSparseHTree() and
 * SparseHTree::endpointForUnit(), so endpoint ids can never drift between the
 * emitted Garnet topology and the runtime routing.
 *
 * MODEL: only PE-hosting branches are materialized, down to the placement level.
 *  - Each PE home unit -> a leaf ENDPOINT; endpoint e == PE e.
 *  - For every router that has EMPTY (no-PE) children, ONE abstract ENDPOINT is
 *    attached at that router -- the maximal-empty-subtree root, on the genuinely
 *    shared parent link (invariant #4: abstract = terminus, no deeper). A non-PE
 *    unit routes to the abstract endpoint of its DEEPEST LIVE ancestor, so near
 *    (same bank as a PE) vs far (other channel) is tiered by real tree distance.
 *  - Below the tree = the aggregate DRAM model (tech base latency + M/D/1 +
 *    channel-BW), charged by the caller. No per-unit nodes, no compute.
 *
 * Node count ~ PEs x tree-depth, not unit count -> sparse sweeps stay tiny.
