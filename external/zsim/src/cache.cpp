     * 1.11.17 (audit go-through): system-scope caches are named
     * "<node>_l2-0" etc., which the bare prefix test could never match --
     * the 1.9.29 node-prefix parser bug, re-made here. Match the level
     * token anywhere after an optional node prefix.
     *
     * 1.11.57 (latent F025): TWO DEFECTS IN THAT TEST, both of the same kind
     * -- the code matched something narrower than the comment claimed.
     * (a) find('_') takes the FIRST underscore, but node names may contain
     *     one: the documented "hbm_pim" node yields base = "pim_l2-0", which
     *     starts with 'p' and can never match, so that node's LLC would never
     *     mark the tracker. rfind takes the LAST underscore, which is the one
     *     that separates the node prefix from the level token in every name
     *     the emitters write ("<node>_l2-0").
     * (b) the comment advertised an "llc*" pattern the test could not
     *     express: for a name beginning "llc", base[1] is 'l', which fails
     *     both digit branches. Either the pattern or the claim had to go;
     *     the pattern is cheap, so it is implemented.
     * Nothing reachable moves today: the only consumer of
     * pgSharedCacheActivePhases is the DEVICE-scope branch of
     * runPowerAnalysis, and device-scope caches are emitted with no node
     * prefix at all ("l2", "l3"), where both spellings already matched. The
     * system path never reads the counter. */
