/**
 * QEMU TCG Plugin for ZSim In-Process Simulation
 *
 * Replaces zsim.cpp's Pin-based instrumentation with QEMU user-mode
 * emulation callbacks. Drives the full ZSim core/cache/memory hierarchy.
 *
 * This plugin is loaded by QEMU via:
 *   qemu-x86_64 -plugin libzsim_qemu.so,shmid=N,cfg=<path>,out=<dir> -- workload
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   - qemu_plugin_install() attaches shared memory, calls SimInit()
 *   - tb_trans_cb() creates BblInfo per translation block
 *   - mem_cb() calls Core::load/store via function pointers
 *   - insn_exec_cb() calls Core::bbl, triggers phase barriers
 *   - vcpu_init_cb() registers threads with scheduler
 *   - atexit_cb() calls SimEnd() and dumps stats

 * cores[c]->getCycles()). roiRel needs the baseline of the core the RANK is on.
 *
 * In SYSTEM-scope co-sim the two disagree catastrophically: a rank (tid) runs on
 * a DEVICE PE whose cid != tid, and the old read mpi_roi_base_cyc[tid] aliased
 * HOST cores 0..3 -- carrying their ~16.5M pre-ROI (MPI_Init-era) clock -- so
 * roiRel clamped to 0 for tid 0..3. That collapsed the SEND/RECV rendezvous: the
 * receiver's `cur` read 0, so each recv advanced by the FULL send_time and the
 * reduce ROOT ACCUMULATED the senders' stamps (~2.6M) instead of advancing to
 * their max. Reading the baseline of the rank's ACTUAL core (cids[tid]) puts
 * getCycles() and the baseline on the same clock axis and fixes it.
 *
 * That correction is CONFINED to g_cosim_mode. The catastrophic aliasing exists
 * ONLY where host and device cids coexist (system scope). In DEVICE scope every
 * core is a device PE, the old [tid] indexing is already correct, AND it is
 * DETERMINISTIC -- whereas [cids[tid]] would couple roiRel to the run-to-run
 * PE assignment (cids[tid] is not stable across runs, per-PE baselines differ),
 * making device-scope MPI nondeterministic and NOT bit-identical to prior data.
 * So device scope keeps [tid] verbatim (bit-identical to the 1.8.6 baseline).
 *
 * Documented residual (both scopes): mpi_roi_base_cyc is a shared per-CORE-slot
 * table, so a rank's stamp still carries a small per-rank baseline skew from the
 * slot it reads. It is DETERMINISTIC and present in all prior co-sim MPI data; a

 * back to mpi_roi_base_cyc[tid], which for tid 0..3 is the aliased HOST-core
 * baseline (~16.5M) -- flipping roiRel between the correct value and 0 mid-run.
 * That inconsistency made a rank publish alternating send-time stamps and, rarely

 * The general, correct source for the magic op value is the ACTUAL %rcx

 * registered with QEMU_PLUGIN_CB_R_REGS.  The register handle is resolved once
 * (per-vCPU context) and cached; a reusable GByteArray avoids per-op alloc.
 *
 * NOTE: the vendored qemu-plugin.h in this tree (external/zsim/include) is a
 * minimal subset that predates the register-read API and does NOT pull in
 * <glib.h>, whose include dir is also absent from the build flags.  We are
 * constrained to edit only this .cpp, so we locally declare the small glib ABI
 * (matching system glib-2.0 struct layouts) and the QEMU register API.  These

             * future" assert -- all firing right after the last rank drains.
             * The symmetric migrate-IN (host->DEVICE ALU cores, no contention
             * sim) never corrupts; only the device->HOST-InOrder leg does.
             * Confirmed by bisection: skipping ONLY this leg makes 12/12 gemv +
