// PIMID intensive DRAM energy layer -- RELOCATED into Ramulator2 (1.9.10).
//
// This is the single source of the per-access (intensive) DRAM energy the PIMID
// power path consumes. It lives inside external/ramulator so the physics belongs
// to Ramulator2, not the PIMID wrapper; the wrapper (ramulator_wrapper.cpp) is now
// a thin reader that forwards its timing getters into these functions.
//
// The per-tech IDD/VDD tables here are PART-NUMBER-SOURCED datasheet values
// (Micron part classes named below) -- WITH ONE EXCEPTION, the idd2p column.
// 1.11.56 (audit D006): that blanket claim covered a column that was never
// read off a datasheet. idd2p is a precharge-POWER-DOWN current; the DDR/LPDDR
// classes above publish IDD2P, but the HBM rows were entered as "30-40% of
// IDD2N per JESD precharge-standby-powerdown deltas" -- a rule of thumb, not a
// part number -- and HBM2's own entry (17 -> 7) is 41.2%, outside the band its
// comment states. The claim is narrowed here, and the consumer says so at the
// point of use (RamulatorWrapper::getBackgroundSystemMW) rather than leaving a
// header comment to carry the disclosure. The other columns are unaffected.
// 1.11.46 (FIX-PRE-FLEET L189): the claim
// that they "mirror the per-impl current_presets" was FALSE and is withdrawn:
// measured against the tree, DDR4.cpp's Default preset is {60,50,55,145,145,
// IDD5B 362} vs this table's {58,35,42,140,150, IDD5 155} -- the divergence
// lands on the IDD4W write term 1.11.5 introduced, and the upstream DDR5
// preset is a byte-identical copy of DDR4's (generic, not a DDR5 part). The
// upstream presets are unlabelled defaults for the command-driven extensive
// model (drampower_enable, off in our runs); THIS table is the authoritative
// intensive source, and IDD5 here is the average-refresh current, not
// upstream's IDD5B burst figure -- different definitions, not a typo. Ramulator2's own command-driven
// power model (update_powers()/s_total_*energy, gated by drampower_enable) produces
// EXTENSIVE totals over a full simulation; this header produces the INTENSIVE
// per-64B-access / per-device values used for analytical energy accounting. Both
// draw from the same datasheet numbers.
//
// Formulas: Micron TN-41-01 (row ACT+PRE and read-burst energy); ODT/termination =
// resistor-network dissipation VDDQ^2/Rtt over the bit period, per I/O standard.

     *          in Table 59); it is fixed in DDR3.cpp in the same release.
     *          DDR3 refresh was priced at 74% of the standard's occupancy.

     *   HBM3   160.0 -> 260.0  SOURCED. JESD238B.01 Table 93, printed p.165
     *          (PDF p.179): tRFCab = 260 ns at 4 Gb/channel (both of its
     *          realisations, 8 Gb/die 8-High and 16 Gb/die 4-High). The
     *          simulated org is HBM3_4Gb. 160 ns appears at NO HBM3 density --
     *          the tabulated values are 260/310/350/410/450 and TBD -- and it
     *          contradicted HBM3.cpp's own tRFC table, which already had 260.
     *
     *   DDR5   295.0 -> 195.0  DERIVED-FROM-IDENTITY, not sourced. JESD79-5 is
     *          NOT held by this tree, so no external check is possible; but
     *          the tree's own DDR5.cpp tRFC_TABLE gives tRFC1 = 195 ns at 8 Gb
     *          and 295 ns at 16 Gb, and the emitted org is DDR5_8Gb_x8. The
     *          energy layer was refreshing a 16 Gb die while the timing layer
     *          refreshed an 8 Gb one; they cannot both be right, and the
     *          identity that settles it -- both layers must describe the org
     *          actually simulated -- needs no standard. The provenance line
     *          below still names the 16 Gb DDR5-4800 part the IDD CURRENTS
     *          were read from; that stays a stated mismatch (F041).
     *
     *   HBM2   160.0 -> 260.0  DERIVED-FROM-IDENTITY, not sourced. The JESD235
     *          family text is NOT held (misc/ carries only the HBM ballout
     *          spreadsheet), so no external check is possible; but HBM2.cpp's
     *          own tRFC_TABLE gives 260 ns at the emitted HBM2_4Gb density.
     *          The two layers of one technology disagreed by 1.6x.
     *
     * NOT touched, deliberately, and each for a stated reason:
     *   DDR4 350.0. The audit marks the whole DDR4 energy row UNCHECKABLE
     *     (JESD79-4 is not held) and does not flag this one, so it stays. For
     *     the record it is NOT identical to DDR4.cpp's tRFC1 at 8 Gb, which is
     *     360 ns -- a 2.8% gap, an order of magnitude smaller than the four
     *     mismatches fixed above, and 350 ns is a real figure for the Micron
     *     8 Gb DDR4-2400 class the IDD column came from. Flagged here so the
     *     next pass with JESD79-4 in hand can settle it rather than rediscover
     *     it.
     *   GDDR6 220.0. JESD250D publishes no tRFC at all (Table 73 printed p.162
     *     leaves tRFCab and tRFCpb blank) and no GDDR6 vendor sheet is held.
     *   every trefi_ns. All are already correct or UNCHECKABLE. The
     * LPDDR5 trefi 3904.0 disagrees with LPDDR5.cpp's tREFI_BASE 3906 by 2 ns;

 * 1.11.57 (latent D005): the `bool termination_enable = true` parameter is
 * GONE. It was a documented knob with no writer: both call sites in
 * ramulator_wrapper.cpp passed two arguments, nothing in src/ or include/ ever

 * added the knob at the wrong layer, because "no termination" is a property of
 * the I/O standard (LVSTL, HBM's unterminated interposer) that this function
 * already decides from the technology. Deleted rather than wired up.
 *
 * 1.11.57 (latent D017): THE RATE COMES FROM THE CALLER, and there is now one
 * rate table in the tree instead of two. This function used to carry its own
 * mtps column -- DDR3 1600, DDR4 2400, DDR5 4800, GDDR6 14000, LPDDR5 6400,
 * and 3200 for anything else -- beside CactiIOWrapper::dramRateMTs(), which
 * carries the same quantity for the same technologies. The two are the halves
 * of one access: dramRateMTs decides the bandwidth and the CACTI-IO
 * termination figure, this column decided the bit period the scheme-table
 * termination is integrated over. They had already drifted: 1.11.57 (C001)
 * moved DDR5 to 3200 MT/s in dramRateMTs to match the preset this tree
 * simulates, and this column stayed at 4800, i.e. a 1.5x error waiting on the
 * day DDR5 stops taking the exact-map CACTI-IO path. It was invisible because
 * every technology that reaches this table today either has an exact CACTI-IO
 * map (DDR3/DDR4/DDR5, whose result replaces this one) or returns before the
 * rate is read (HBM). The transfer rate is a specification primitive and
 * belongs in one place; the electricals below (scheme, VDDQ, Rtt, Ron) are
 * interface-standard properties and stay here, where they are sourced.
 *
 * 1.11.22 (user decision D12) -- DERIVED FROM THE JEDEC I/O STANDARDS the
 * technologies actually cite, replacing a per-scheme fudge factor whose
 * values the 1.11.15 audit showed were transposed. Two independent errors
 * were confirmed, both from normative text:
 *
 *  POD (DDR4 = POD12/JESD8-24, DDR5 = POD11, GDDR6 = POD135/JESD8-21C):
 *    "The POD driver uses a 40/60 Ohm output impedance that drives into a
 *     60 Ohm equivalent terminator tied to VDDQ" and "the terminator is
 *     disabled when the output driver is enabled" (JESD8-21C.01 cl.3);
 *    "signals ... are not generally expected to pull to VSS ... pull-up-only
 *     parallel input termination" (JESD8-25 cl.1).
 *    => driving HIGH the line sits at VDDQ and NO DC current flows; driving
 *       LOW the loop is the driver pull-down IN SERIES with the terminator.
 *       So duty ~0.5 for random data (we had 1.0), and the loop resistance
 *       is Rpd+Rtt (we used Rtt alone -- a further 100/60 = 1.67x). Combined
 *       we overstated GDDR6 termination by 3.33x.
 *
 *  SSTL (DDR3 = SSTL-15): terminated to VTT = VDDQ/2, so current flows in
 *    BOTH states (duty 1.0 -- we had 0.5) but the voltage ACROSS the
 *    terminated loop is VDDQ/2, not VDDQ. The two corrections partly cancel,
 *    which is why the transposition was not obvious in the totals.
 *    Every DDR3 constant below is normative, from JESD79-3D:
 *      Rpd = 34 Ohm: Table 38 "Output Driver DC Electrical Characteristics",
 *        RON34Pd/RON34Pu = RZQ/7 with RZQ = 240 Ohm; selected by MR1{A5,A1}
 *        = {0,1} (Figure 10). The other legal strength is RZQ/6 = 40 Ohm.
 *      Rtt = 40 Ohm: Table 41 "ODT DC Electrical Characteristics", RTT40 =
 *        RZQ/6, selected by MR1{A9,A6,A2} = {0,1,1} (Figure 10).
 *      Mid-rail: the SAME Table 41 row builds RTT40 from RTT40Pu80 and
 *        RTT40Pd80, each RZQ/3 = 80 Ohm, i.e. a split pull-up/pull-down pair
 *        whose Thevenin point is specified as "Deviation of VM w.r.t.
 *        VDDQ/2, DVM: -5/+5 %". That row IS the v_term = VDDQ/2 below; it is
 *        not an inference from the SSTL name.
 *
 *  LVSTL (LPDDR5): GROUND-REFERENCED, and it DOES terminate. This row
 *    returned 0 until 1.11.26 on the claim "unterminated by design". Micron's
 *    LPDDR5 datasheets say otherwise, in the feature list itself:
 *    "Programmable VSS on-die termination (ODT)", "Interface-LVSTL 0.5/0.3",
 *    "VDDQ = 0.50V or 0.45V TYP; 0.30V TYP (ODT off)", RON = 40 ohm
 *    (misc/MICT-S-A0025741931-1.pdf; misc/315b-441b-561b-y52q-*.pdf).
 *    So it is a THIRD topology: POD terminates to VDDQ, SSTL to a VDDQ/2
 *    mid-rail, LVSTL to VSS. Current flows while the driver holds the line
 *    HIGH -- the mirror of POD -- duty ~0.5 for unbiased data, loop = driver
 *    pull-up + terminator. The 0.5 V rail is what makes it cheap: against
 *    DDR5's 1.1 V that is 4.8x less V^2 before resistance divides.
 *    RESIDUAL CLOSED (1.11.63, JESD209-5C acquired): the standard's own MR11
 *    definition (Table 84, printed p.144) gives "000B: Disable (Default)" for
 *    DQ ODT -- the JEDEC default operating point is UNTERMINATED, and the
 *    RZQ/1..6 ladder (RZQ = 240 ohm -> 240/120/80/60/48/40) is a controller
 *    option with no default rung. So the pre-1.11.26 "returns 0" behaviour
 *    was RIGHT for the default configuration, for a reason nobody had the
 *    document to state: current flows only when a controller has enabled
 *    ODT. rtt = 0 in the row above encodes the default; Micron's IDD
 *    conditions are ODT-off, so the array-energy layer describes the same
 *    configuration by construction.
 *  HBM: 0, and now with a normative citation rather than physics reasoning:
 *    JESD238B.01 cl.9.1 measures HBM3 read-burst current with "IOUT = 0mA;
 *    Ctotal = 2.5 pF" -- an unterminated capacitive load.
 *
 * BOUNDARY (stated, not hidden): the 0.5 POD duty assumes an unbiased bit
 * stream. DBIac is enabled during JEDEC IDD measurement and deliberately
 * skews the LOW fraction, so the true duty is data-dependent; D12's IDD
 * cross-check is what pins that residual. */
/* 1.11.63 (R7, user ruling 2026-08-24): READ/WRITE SPLIT LOOPS. The single

 *
 * JEDEC IDD5 is the all-bank auto-refresh current, measured with the banks
 * precharged; the device draws it for tRFC out of every tREFI. It is an
 * ABSOLUTE current, not an increment, and a device must EXIT power-down to
 * accept a REFRESH command -- so for the tRFC/tREFI duty fraction the unit
 * draws IDD5 whatever state it was otherwise holding, and its own state
 * current for the remainder.
 *
 *     P(state) = vdd * ( idd_state * (1 - duty) + idd5 * duty )
 *
 * That expression is state-independent, which the previous structure was not:
 * refreshMW() below returns the excess over IDD3N, correct only when added to
 * an IDD3N baseline, and backgroundUnitMW() added it over the IDLE fraction
 * too, where the baseline is IDD2N or IDD2P. Since IDD2P < IDD3N, refresh was
 * UNDER-charged during power-down by vdd*(idd3n-idd2p)*duty -- for HBM3,
 * 1.1 * (22-7) * (160/3900) = 0.68 mW/unit, ~2.6% of the 26.4 mW per-unit
 * background, 10.8 mW across a 16-channel stack at full idle. Inert on the
 * present corpus (1.11.20 measured r_idle = 0: memory-bound kernels keep the
 * controller busy every phase), so this is a correctness fix, not a results
 * change -- backgroundUnitMW is bit-identical at r_idle = 0 by construction.
