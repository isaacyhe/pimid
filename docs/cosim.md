# Host-Device Co-simulation

Co-simulation (`scope: system`) runs a general-purpose **host** and a
**PIM device** as one system: the host is a real CPU (out-of-order cores,
cache hierarchy, its own main memory), the device is processing elements
inside memory. An offloaded kernel migrates from the host onto the device
PEs and back; the boundary costs -- launch, coherence, and the host<->device
bridge -- are priced explicitly. The device-side execution is the *identical*
code path a standalone `scope: device` run uses (same PE memory interfaces,
same Garnet/analytical NoC, same JEDEC-derived memory timing), so device-only
cycles are unchanged by co-sim.

There are **no special co-sim workloads**: any ordinary ROI-marked workload
runs in co-sim unchanged. In a standalone device simulation only the ROI
(the kernel) is counted; in co-sim the host phases and the boundary costs are
added around that same region.

```bash
./build/pimid --method exec --scope system \
    --config examples/cosim/host_device_basic.yaml \
    --workload benchmarks/pim_kernels/gemv/gemv_omp --size 512 \
    --workload-type openmp
```

> `total_energy_nJ` alongside cycles, exactly like the device-only figures --
> the host OoO McPAT power path is fixed (a missing `fp_issue_width` XML param
> had left the FP issue queue with zero ports, crashing power analysis; earlier

> `--no-power` remains available for fast timing-only iteration.

## System model

- **Host = rank-0 master.** The co-sim host is a **single OoO core** at
  2 GHz (crossbar degenerates to core + MC + bridge ports; the busy-wait
  occupies it during the kernel; the rank-0-master requirement is trivially
  satisfied). Under MPI the host runs legitimate serial master work (per-rank
  prep) -- not an artifact. The default (and the fig5 cells) is a single OoO
  core; an **in-order host core is also supported** as of 1.7.7 (the recorder
  `memRespCycle` skew fix -- see [Limitations](#limitations)).
- **Device = PIM.** PEs (default `alu_core`) placed at a memory level (BANK,
  SUBARRAY, ...) behind the device's own memory technology and NoC.
- **Two fabrics, one bridge.** The device-internal H-tree (JEDEC-derived) and
  the host crossbar are separate; the host<->device **bridge** joins them and
  carries only boundary traffic (launch cmd/ack, coherence flush, Case-2 DMA).
  See [architecture.md](architecture.md) and [network.md](network.md).

### `scope: system` vs `scope: device`

| | `scope: device` | `scope: system` (co-sim) |
|---|---|---|
| host | none (a hidden host prepared the layout, uncounted by design) | real OoO host: cores, caches, own main memory |
| measured region | ROI (kernel) only | task region: flush/launch/kernel/busy-wait/readback |
| boundary costs | none | launch + coherence + bridge, all explicit |
| device cycles | reference | **identical** (parity invariant) |

**Parity invariant** (enforced by validation): the device-side cycles of a
co-sim run agree with a standalone device-scope run of the same kernel. If
they ever diverge, a second device model has crept in -- file a bug.

## The measurement window (task region)

Co-sim vs baseline compares the **task region**, not device-kernel-only and
not the whole process. The window opens when "inputs are ready in host
memory" and closes when "results are visible in host memory":

- **Co-sim** opens BEFORE the first boundary action; the flush/invalidate,
  launch cmd/ack, kernel execution, host busy-wait, and readback all sit
  INSIDE it. At `roi_begin` the plugin snapshots each core's baseline
  (`markRoiBegin`) so the reported cycles cover only the task region, not the
  pre-ROI array-init/setup.
- **Baseline** (see [NO_OFFLOAD](#no_offload-baseline)) wraps the equivalent
  host compute, including MPI communication.

Both **exclude** process startup, input generation, warmup, and teardown --
identical shared work that would only dilute ratios toward 1. A kernel-only
window would omit exactly the boundary costs the design charges (flattering
PIM); a whole-process window would bury the signal.

## The six boundary decisions

The 1.7.x design settled six subsystems. All are realized as deterministic,
config-driven charges emitted into the ZSim config and applied by the plugin.

### 1. Launch -- doorbell + cmd/ack + busy-wait (`system.launch`)

Offload launch models a **user-mode doorbell** (no syscall) plus a
runtime/OS software dispatch, then a command packet across the bridge and an
acknowledgement back. It is charged on the **host core at the offload
doorbell** (`roi_begin` / `WORK_BEGIN`), before the device migration, so it
lands on the host timeline inside the task window:

```
launch_cost = doorbell_ns + dispatch_ns
            + bridge_crossing(cmd_bytes) + bridge_crossing(ack_bytes)
```

Defaults: `doorbell_ns: 300`, `dispatch_ns: 5000` (~5 us), `cmd_bytes: 64`,
`ack_bytes: 64` -- the low end of the famous ~5-20 us GPU kernel-launch band
(driver + runtime dispatch). DDR5 vs HBM3 differ **only** in the bridge
component; doorbell and dispatch are shared.

Completion is **busy-wait only** on the device-written fence (CUDA-default:
no IRQ mode, no polling knob). In device-only co-sim this is honest by
construction -- the single launcher thread is either on the host or on the
device PE, never two places at once and never racing ahead to do other host
work during the device compute (there is none). The host is therefore
self-penalized for the wait exactly as a CUDA busy-wait would be.

### 2. Coherence -- address-space visibility (`system.coherence`)

Coherence follows **address-space visibility**, not physical placement.

- **Case 1 -- `mode: unified`** (default; our HBM3/DDR5 figure: PEs
  dereference host pointers). Before the device reads DRAM the host must make
  its caches consistent. At `roi_begin`, on the host core, all as one charge:
  `flush(inputs)` writes back dirty lines (real writeback traffic) and
  `invalidate(outputs)` discards stale output lines (placed at BEGIN to kill
  the mid-kernel stale-eviction hazard). Cost is an analytic upper bound --
  the whole footprint is treated as dirty
  (conservative-against-PIM):

  ```
  flush_cycles = flush_fixed_ns + ceil(footprint_bytes / writeback_bytes_per_cycle)
  ```

  `roi_end` charges nothing explicit: host output reads are natural cold
  misses, already priced by the cache model.

- **Case 2 -- `mode: separate`** (even if the same physical DRAM). Cache
  bypass (uncached / WC window or DMA staging); the cost lives in the transfer
  path. No flush is charged -- the two-layer bridge bulk-DMA path already
  prices the crossing. A named configuration, parked for the discrete-device
  (Mode-2) studies.

Baselines **never** flush (the host keeps using its caches), so this cost is
PIM-side only and honesty demands it. Defaults: `flush_fixed_ns: 200`,
`footprint_bytes: 16777216` (16 MiB), `writeback_bw_gbs` auto = host memory
aggregate bandwidth (per-channel x channels).

### 3. Host network -- crossbar, same fidelity ladder as the device

The host fabric is a first-class subsystem with the same two-tier ladder as
the device (analytical | detailed) and identical config syntax
(`system.hosts[].noc`). Default topology is **crossbar** (uniform one-hop;
contention at ports, not hops).

- A **1-core host has no fabric** -- a crossbar degenerates at a single core
  (core -> caches -> MC direct). The core-to-memory path is the calibrated
  analytic memory latency (see [cosim_calibration.md](cosim_calibration.md)).
- A **multi-core host** (the 4/16-core baselines) adds a fixed one-hop
  crossbar latency (`hop_cycles`, core clock) on the host memory path; port
  contention is already priced by the host MC M/D/1 model, so the fabric stays
  analytic.

> **Shipped-behavior note.** Only the **analytical** host tier is wired in
> 1.7.4: `system.hosts[].noc.model` is parsed and echoed, but a detailed host
> Garnet instance is *not* instantiated (the second-Garnet host tier is a
> later 1.7.x increment). `model: detailed` on a host is currently inert.

### 4. Bridge -- two-layer protocol x phy (`system.bridge`)

The host<->device link is a **two-layer** model: `protocol`
(native | ddr_t | cxl_mem | loadstore) selects per-transaction overhead
terms; `phy` (on_die | pcb | interposer | serdes) selects width / rate / wire
+ command-interface pipeline latency. A crossing costs:

```
bridge_cycles = phy_latency + protocol_overhead + ceil(bytes / aggregate_bytes_per_cycle)
```

where aggregate bandwidth = per-channel GB/s x channels. All fields are
optional and default from the **device** memory technology (the bridge always
keys off the device tech). Illegal combinations are config errors:

- `cxl_mem` requires `serdes`
- `loadstore` requires `on_die`
- `native` is forbidden on `serdes` (native needs the tech's own MC class)

Per-tech defaults (BW reuses the simulator's channel rates):

| tech | protocol | phy | BW/ch | latency | ch | uncached |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DDR3 | native | pcb | 12.8 GB/s | 20 ns | 1 | 200 ns |
| DDR4 | native | pcb | 19.2 GB/s | 20 ns | 1 | 200 ns |
| DDR5 | native | pcb | 25.6 GB/s | 18 ns | 1 | 200 ns |
| LPDDR5 | native | pcb | 12.8 GB/s | 12 ns | 1 | 200 ns |
| GDDR6 | native | pcb | 32 GB/s | 10 ns | 2 | 200 ns |
| HBM2 | native | interposer | 38.4 GB/s | 30 ns | 8 | 230 ns |
| HBM3 | native | interposer | 51.2 GB/s | 30 ns | 16 | 335 ns |
| SRAM | loadstore | on_die | 128 GB/s | 2 ns | 1 | 30 ns |
| STT_MRAM | loadstore | on_die | 128 GB/s | 2 ns | 1 | 30 ns |
| ReRAM | ddr_t | pcb | 25.6 GB/s | 18 ns | 1 | 250 ns |
| PCM | cxl_mem | serdes | 64 GB/s | 200 ns | 1 | 300 ns |

The interposer latency is **wire + command-interface/MC pipeline** (~5-6 ns
wire + ~24-25 ns pipeline), NOT a SerDes tail -- HBM has no SerDes. The NVM
trio (SRAM/STT on_die, ReRAM pcb, PCM serdes) deliberately spans the attach
ladder; overriding to a common attach isolates the media alone.

### 5. Memory topology -- `is_default_mem` + `host.mem`

Each attached device carries `is_default_mem`:

- **`true`** (default) -- the PIM device **is** the host's main memory; host
  tech = device tech by construction (preserves the host-tech = device-tech
  matrix). Ordinary host traffic lands in it. A `host.mem` block here is
  redundant and ignored with a warning.
- **`false`** -- the device is accelerator-side memory only; the host **must**
  supply a `host.mem` block (technology + optional capacity/BW/channels), a
  plain non-PIM memory of any of the 11 techs. Omission is a **config error**
  (no silent DDR5 fallback). Host-memory tech then becomes an explicit
  variable, and only true host<->device traffic crosses the bridge.

The two are orthogonal to the coherence Case 1/2 knob (natural pairings
true<->Case 1, false<->Case 2, but independent -- CXL can expose unified
addressing over non-default memory). **Baselines always run on the device's
tech** regardless (no host-tech confound -- the retired v140 mistake).

### 6. Host memory pricing -- calibrated host-path adder

Host main-memory idle latency is a **physical composition**
(tRCD + tCAS from the memory model) **plus a calibrated host-path adder** so
the effective latency matches measured real sockets (DDR5 ~110 ns, HBM3
~235 ns). The adder is host-role only -- device (PE) pricing never routes
through it, so PIM-side timing stays clean. It ships both as an aggregate
(`memory.latency_adder_ns`) and as an optional four-way decomposition
(`memory.host_path { fabric_ns, coherence_ns, mc_pipeline_ns, phy_ns }`).
Host memory bandwidth is a single aggregate M/D/1 queue at
per-channel x channels GB/s, so one DDR5 channel saturates under many host
cores while HBM3's 32x-wider aggregate stays unsaturated. Full calibration
methodology and anchors: [cosim_calibration.md](cosim_calibration.md).

## NO_OFFLOAD baseline

`PIMID_COSIM_NO_OFFLOAD=1` turns the ROI/WORK magic ops into **stat markers
only**: no device migration, no bridge/coherence/launch charge, no
offload-driven device pricing. The unmodified OMP/MPI kernel runs on the host
cores end to end against the host memory technology, from the **same binary**
as the offload run. ROI begin/end still delimit the measured task region.
This yields the host-only baseline cells (1/4/16 OoO host cores). See
[examples.md](examples.md) for the `baseline_host_{1,4,16}core.yaml` configs
and [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md) for the experiment shape.

## Limitations

- **In-order host supported (fixed 1.7.7).** Both `ooo_core` and
  `in_order_core` now work as the co-sim host. Earlier 1.7.x required an OoO
  host: the in-order pipeline's CoreRecorder event chain asserts
  `startCycle >= prevRespCycle`, but `CoreRecorder::cSimEnd` folds a contention
  skew into the phase-1 clock while InOrderCore's private `memRespCycle` cursor
  never received it, so an in-order host on the migration path tripped that
  recorder assertion. The 1.7.7 one-line fix advances `memRespCycle` by the
  same skew, so the cursor and the recorded clock stay consistent. (The
  busy-wait / boundary-charge accounting is core-type agnostic.)
- **Single device in 1.7.x.** One PIM device (plus an optional separate
  `host.mem`). Multiple attached memory devices are a later increment; the
  schema already generalizes but the plumbing is not built.
- **Detailed host NoC not wired** (decision 3 note above): the analytical
  host tier is shipped; the detailed host Garnet is a later increment.
- **Device-side weave +-1-phase quantum.** The device-side weave (in-order /
  OOO weave cores) has a residual +-1-phase QUANTUM nondeterminism in how a
  phase boundary lands relative to contention (<=0.4% at production scale).
  This is a device-model effect, independent of the host core type, and is
  deferred to the 1.8 PDES rework -- it is NOT fixed by 1.7.7.
- **Phase-exclusivity assumed.** Host and PEs are temporally disjoint by
  construction in serial offload (host touches memory only outside the ROI,
  PEs only inside), so the only shared cost at the boundary is the flush. This
  is honest for our kernels; streaming/overlapped offload would need explicit
  host<->PE channel contention (future).

## MPI semantics

`libpimid_mpi.so` provides the MPI ABI (Init, Send/Recv, Sendrecv, Bcast,
Reduce/Allreduce, Barrier, Scatter/Gather, Allgather/Allgatherv, Alltoall)
over a POSIX shared-memory mailbox. `MPI_PROC_NULL` send/recv are no-ops per
the standard, so halo-exchange patterns run without deadlock. Collectives are
**timing-faithful, not numerics-faithful**: reduce-style ops transmit all
chunks but do not apply the reduction operator -- workloads needing actual
reduced values should compute them on the root from received chunks.

Under `noc.model: detailed`, all ranks drive ONE logical Garnet network via a
shared record log (see [network.md](network.md)): message payloads and every
rank's memory traffic contend on the same tree. Each rank also occupies its
own placement slice of the device (rank r's address space maps into PE r's
region), so rank-local data is near-data by construction.

## Diagnostics

| env | prints |
|---|---|
| `PIMID_COSIM_TRACE=1` | timestamped thread-lifecycle events (scheduler start/join, offload migrations) to stderr |
| `PIMID_DEBUG_HOSTMEM` | host memory idle-latency composition (physical + host-path adder, per component) |
| `PIMID_DEBUG_COHERENCE` | the deterministic Case-1 flush charge the plugin will apply at roi_begin |
| `PIMID_DEBUG_LAUNCH` | the deterministic launch charge (doorbell + dispatch + bridge cmd/ack) |

These last three are login-node observable (printed at config emission), so
you can inspect the charges without running the simulator on a compute node.
