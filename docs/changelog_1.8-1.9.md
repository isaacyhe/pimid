# Changelog / defect ledger -- 1.8.0 -> 1.9.11

Release + defect ledger for the co-sim MPI window, the measured-feedback MPI
pricing model, and the OMP critical-path metric. One entry per release; each
gives the defect fixed, a one-line root cause, and a data-impact note (which
sweep generations the fix invalidates or corrects). Authoritative source is the
release commit messages; deeper design rationale for 1.9.0 is in
`docs-dev/DESIGN_190_PDES.md`.

## 1.9.11 -- docs-only

Documentation for the 1.9.10 energy-model overhaul (this entry, the yaml
reference knob ladder, and the energy-model notes below). No source change;
no data impact.

## 1.9.10 -- energy-model overhaul: system-scope integration fix + tool-measured memory energy

Eight commits; device-scope TIMING is bit-invariant (same-node A/B gate on the
release binary: 137,094,689 vs 137,091,032 cycles, delta 0.003%, both rc=0).

- **Defect #16 -- system-scope power integration.** `runPerNodePowerAnalysis`
  priced every node over the first host core's contention-EXCLUDED unhalted
  cycles while feeding full aggregate access counts, producing nonphysical
  system powers (379.8 W bfs baselines; kW-class co-sim host nodes; below-idle
  cells). Fix: each node is priced over true wall-clock time in its own clock
  domain (host wall = max(unhalted + contention) across host cores; device
  wall = max device cycles). Device-scope `runPowerAnalysis` is a different
  function and is unaffected.
- **Configurable process node.** `power.tech_node_nm` (+ `device_`/`host_`
  variants); the host now inherits the device node. Finding: the old hardcoded
  7 nm host literal never reached McPAT (a `max(22, n)` clamp), so all landed
  data was already effectively 22 nm; the change is forward-looking, not
  retroactive.
- **Ramulator2 energy layer, tool-measured.** Root cause of the 0.000-nJ
  energy reports: a never-fed counter behind a cycle-0 guard, plus "INFERRED"
  placeholder `bank_energy_pJ` constants. The energy layer now lives inside
  Ramulator2 (`external/ramulator/src/dram/pimid_energy.h`): JEDEC IDD/VDD
  per-command energies with first-class `current_presets` for all seven DRAM
  standards (DDR3/LPDDR5/GDDR6/HBM2/HBM3 added; the DDR4-class reuse fallback
  is retired), background/refresh power from standby currents, and per-scheme
  termination/ODT (SSTL/POD/LVSTL): DDR3 17.6 / DDR4 9.4 / DDR5 5.25 /
  GDDR6 2.6 / LPDDR5 0 / HBM 0 pJ/bit. The wrapper is a thin reader; the
  relocation was verified value-invariant to the pre-migration table.
- **Off-chip channel, die-boundary split.** CPU-side McPAT MC/PHY (~9 pJ/bit
  at 22 nm) + DRAM-side I/O (0.76) + termination (5.25) = ~15 pJ/bit for DDR5,
  inside the published 15-22 pJ/bit full-channel band; HBM carries no
  termination (interposer), a physics-derived asymmetry.
- **Known boundary.** The device H-tree fabric is priced as a McPAT bus-mode
  wire/repeater datapath (7.3 mW for a 16-PE tree) in the analysis layer that
  produced the published dataset; the binary's own per-node NoC printout still
  uses router-mode pricing, and a runtime `power.noc_model` knob is roadmap
  work, not shipped in this release.
- **Data impact.** Timing: none (gate above). System-scope powers/energies
  produced before 1.9.10 are nonphysical and were re-derived; device-scope
  energies were re-derived onto the measured per-command constants. The
  release's knobs are documented in `docs/yaml_reference.md`.

## 1.9.9 -- docs-only

Documentation for 1.9.8 (this entry, badge). No source change.

## 1.9.8 -- power-derivation fixes (1-PE NoC gating; subarray fan-in overcount)

- **Defect 1.** runPowerAnalysis gated the in-memory-network power on
  num_pes > 1, dropping ~4.57 W of H-tree leakage for every 1-PE device run
  (reported 0.099 W). Fixed: gate also fires on hierarchy_enabled. 1-PE
  pecount power/energy re-derived from existing logs (no re-simulation);
  multi-PE cells bit-identical.
- **Defect 2.** buildNoCLevelsForMcPAT used a hardcoded x2 subarray->bank
  fan-in instead of config.subarrays_per_bank (32 for HBM3), overfeeding
  McPAT ~16x router counts at SUBARRAY placement only (65 W vs a physical
  ~5.5 W). Fixed; SUBARRAY placement rows re-derived; other levels
  bit-identical.
- **Documented (no code change).** Power templates key off microarch class,
  not timing fidelity: simple_core and in_order_core share the single-issue
  template (~9.06 W). total_power_W is leakage/config-dominated; activity
  moves only trailing digits; Ramulator2 array dynamic energy is reported
  separately.

## 1.9.7 -- docs-only

Documentation for 1.9.6 (this entry, badge). No source change.

## 1.9.6 -- thread-MPI head-of-line deadlock at >16 ranks

- **Defect.** The in-process MPI transport's per-rank mailbox ring (16 slots)
  deadlocked under source-matched receive when >16 ranks flooded a collective
  root: the receiver would not consume the ring head (wrong source) and the
  wanted sender could not append (ring full). bfs (per-level gathers) at
  32/64 ranks froze within ~5 phases; 8/16 ranks and one-shot-reduce kernels
  never filled the ring. Latent since 1.6; exposed when measured pricing
  (1.9.0) changed rank arrival patterns.
- **Fix.** Unexpected-message staging queue per receiver: when the ring is
  full and the wanted source absent, the head message is staged (freeing the
  slot, waking the sender). Source matching, per-source FIFO, and consumed
  timestamps unchanged -- deadlock-free by construction, deterministic.
  Capacity is now elastic at any rank count.
- **Data impact.** pc_32/pc_64 MPI bfs cells producible (v196 tags); all
  other cells gate-verified unchanged (pe16 -3.5% cross-host band, gemv-32
  +1.6%, cosim clean with exact 16x flush arithmetic, OMP within its
  documented band at 0.82%).

## 1.9.5 -- docs-only

Documentation for 1.9.4 (this entry, cores.md note, badge). No source change.

## 1.9.4 -- simple_core phantom wall-clock leak under thread-MPI

- **Defect.** simple_core's frozen-clock rewind (COMM_END) lowered curCycle
  directly, but SimpleCore::join() re-pins curCycle to the wall-pumped global
  phase clock on every phase crossing -- the rewind did not stick. Rank clocks
  tracked wall time instead of work; on rendezvous-heavy kernels the phantom
  dominated (bfs: 34.6M of 36.9M cycles). Same family as the 1.9.2 OOO defect:
  per-class rewind paths unsafe against clock re-pinning.
- **Fix.** Accumulate the rewind in pimidPhantomWait and net it out at the
  read sites (getCycles / ROI stat) -- join-immune, byte-inert outside MPI
  frozen-clock waits. simple_core-only; other cores + OMP gate-verified
  unchanged (0.1%).
- **Data impact.** simple_core MPI cells re-run (v194): bfs 36.9M -> 8.37M
  (physical: between ooo 3.8M and alu 24.5M, just above in_order 8.1M).

## 1.9.3 -- docs-only

Documentation for 1.9.2 (this entry, cores.md OOO bulk-advance note, version
badge). No source change; no data impact.

## 1.9.2 -- window-safe bulk clock advance for OOO cores (1.6.3 boundary closed)

- **Defect.** Under thread-MPI rendezvous, `OOOCore::join()` applied a raw
  `curCycle = targetCycle` jump while parked, bypassing the window-safe
  `longAdvance()`. A 100K-1M+ cycle rendezvous jump orphaned in-flight
  unbounded-window entries behind `curCycle`; the next window rebase computed a
  negative position and tripped the `ooo_core.h` assert (then SIGSEGV). bfs
  (one collective per frontier level) is the reliable trigger; this is the
  1.6.3 "weave quantum" boundary that had kept OOO+thread-MPI cells pulled.
- **Fix.** Route the parked join through `insWindow.longAdvance()` (drain-then-
  jump; retires in-flight uops instead of discarding; byte-identical to the old
  code when the window is empty; drain bounded by the 1024-cycle horizon).
  OOO-only -- ALU/simple/in-order joins untouched (gate-verified).
- **Data impact.** OOO+MPI cells are now simulatable; the coremodel MPI family
  is re-run on 1.9.2 for single-binary consistency (v192 tag). Validation:
  the crashing cell completes at 3.92M cycles (OOO fastest on MPI bfs, as
  latency hiding predicts); non-bfs OOO cells reproduce v190 to <0.1%; OMP
  path unshifted (0.047%). Note: thread-MPI bfs cells carry multi-percent
  run-to-run spread (worst case of the documented weave nondeterminism), so
  bfs census checks use a tolerance band, not bit-equality.

## 1.9.1 -- docs-only

Documentation refresh for the 1.8.3 -> 1.9.0 train (this file, plus co-sim MPI
window, measured MPI pricing, and OMP critical-path metric edits). No source
change; no data impact.

## 1.9.0 -- measured Garnet-fed-back pricing for thread-MPI (epoch-frozen)

- **Change.** Thread-MPI per-access latency now prices from **measured** Garnet
  congestion via epoch-frozen deterministic feedback; the analytical override
  is demoted to an escape hatch (`PIMID_MPI_ANALYTICAL_PRICING=1`). OMP is
  unchanged (rolling-EWMA live feedback).
- **Root cause of what it replaces.** The naive "read the live per-drain EWMA"
  feedback was 26-196% per-core / ~25% makespan nondeterministic (a fast rank
  folds fewer drains into the rolling scalar than a slow one) and read-depth
  inflated. Epoch-frozen table lookup (read epoch `k-1`'s frozen sample, keyed
  by the access's own ROI-relative cycle) removes the read-instant dependence.
  Three membership leaks fixed en route (pre-ROI pollution, startup-skew
  stamping, partial-bucket folds; DESIGN_190 section 10), built on the
  already-deterministic per-phase batch contents (defect #9 venue-independence).
- **Repeatability reality (residual).** Not bit-exact: the one-pass
  measured-feedback loop converges to a **host-dependent fixpoint** --
  within-host <=0.15% typical per-core (occasional ~0.5%), cross-host 2-7%
  systematic; rank-0 / cut-pinning core host-independent to ~0.05%. Fidelity:
  measured level +5-12% above the analytical floor.
- **Data impact.** Thread-MPI detailed sweeps priced with the old analytical
  override should be **regenerated** with measured feedback. MPI sweeps must be
  run **single-venue** for internal consistency (true venue-independent
  bit-exactness needs two-pass replay, future work). OMP and analytical-model
  cells unaffected.

## 1.8.8 -- OMP critical-path cycle summary (core-0-metric defect)

- **Defect.** Device-scope OMP runs had no critical-path aggregation. Both the
  sweep harness (`grep cycles | head -1`) and `parseZSimOutputFile()` latched
  onto the FIRST per-PE `cycles:` line = **core 0 only**, which reflects only
  that PE's active cycles, not kernel completion (the last PE to finish).
- **Root cause.** Core 0 was a low outlier at 16/64 PEs but representative at 32
  (16 PEs: core0 8% low; 64 PEs: 26% low; 32 PEs: representative), so recording
  it manufactured a spurious bfs HBM3 32-PE +28% cycle spike that "reversed" at
  64.
- **Fix.** Device-scope OMP now emits `OMP cycles: <max> (mean, min, pes,
  critical-path max)` plus a parser-compatible `Total: <sum> cycles (max: <max>)`
  (mirroring the MPI path). Purely additive; per-PE lines / `out.cycles` /
  power untouched.
- **Data impact.** Device-scope OMP sweeps parsed via `head -1` / core-0 carry
  the artifact and must be re-parsed against `(max: N)` (or re-run). The results
  harness OMP branch must switch from `grep cycles | head -1` to the `(max: N)`
  line (flagged out-of-scope in the commit).

## 1.8.7 -- co-sim MPI: tid/cid aliasing, zero-migration ranks, guard, protocolTail

- **Defect #15 class -- tid/cid ROI-baseline aliasing.** `roiRelCycles(tid)`
  read the ROI baseline table by **rank id** while it is written by **core
  index**. In system scope a rank's `cid != tid`, so `tid` 0..3 aliased HOST
  cores' ~16.5M pre-ROI (MPI_Init-era) clock; `roiRel` clamped to 0 and
  collapsed the SEND/RECV rendezvous (reduce root accumulated senders' stamps
  instead of advancing to their max). Fix: index by the rank's actual core
  (`cids[tid]`) + a per-rank last-valid-cid cache. Scoped to co-sim; device
  scope keeps `tid` indexing (correct and deterministic there).
- **Finalized model.** Ranks ARE the device PEs; the post-ROI collective tail
  (closing barrier + Reduce + Finalize) is device-resident, executed and priced
  ON THE PE. **Zero migrations** at window close (the 1.8.4/1.8.6 residual
  device->host legs, incl. rank 0's `roi_end` migration, all removed), which
  also eliminates the 1.8.6 exit race by construction.
- **Cross-axis invariant guard (defect-13 / 1.7.7 tripwire lineage).** At the
  recv rendezvous, a single message advance exceeding the ROI span means the
  clock axes are mismatched -- shout and cap rather than advance by a garbage
  delta. Eliminated a rare ~4% `2^32` rendezvous overflow (Garnet "event too
  far into the future").
- **protocolTail stat.** Per-PE receipt (final PE cycles minus closing-barrier
  marker); visibility only, never alters `cycles`. Co-sim-only, fixed global
  array, so device-scope `Core`/`initStats` stay byte-identical.
- **Data impact.** System-scope (co-sim) MPI data produced before 1.8.7 has the
  collapsed rendezvous and must be regenerated; the flaky ~4% overflow is gone.
  Device-scope MPI unaffected (reproduces the 1.8.6 distribution).

## 1.8.6 -- co-sim MPI exit-protocol heap corruption

- **Defect.** The 1.8.4 closing device->host migrate-out freed a rank's core
  slot mid-handler while a peer immediately entered its contention-sim phase
  pass; under the MPI serial weave the two overlapping handlers iterated
  glibc-heap state unsynchronized and **corrupted the process heap** (the
  "malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk" / QEMU SIGSEGV / Garnet "No output port for
  vnet" panics, and rarely the contention_sim "event too far into the future"
  assert, all right after the last rank drained).
- **Root cause (exit race).** Racy closing migrate-out under
  `simulation.parallel` serial weave (one vcpu may touch simulator state, but a
  migrate-out + peer phase pass overlap). The mirror migrate-IN at window open
  never corrupts.
- **Fix.** Drop the closing migrate-out; the drained rank finishes its short
  post-ROI protocol on its device PE (<1% accounting shift).
- **Data impact.** Pre-1.8.6 co-sim MPI runs crashed non-deterministically
  (~1/6 clean); no trustworthy pre-1.8.6 co-sim MPI data. gemv checksum
  unchanged from 1.8.4; histogram checksum 512.

## 1.8.5 -- reinstate per-rank flush + launch charges in the co-sim MPI window

- **Fix.** Reinstated the per-rank flush + launch boundary charges that 1.8.4
  had deferred, so every rank prices flush + launch on its host core at its
  kernel-entry barrier.
- **Data impact.** Sub-0.05% at sweep scale; negligible.

## 1.8.4 -- defect #14 co-sim MPI ROI window (+ 1.8.3 control-surface tidy)

- **Defect #14 (four layers deep).** Co-sim MPI measured dev=0. Root cause
  spanned: rank-0-only `roi_begin`; a `ROI_BEGIN` thread-branch early-return
  skipping the offload block; a parked-opener wall-order race making
  window-open-time migration impossible; and non-thread-safe
  migration/termination under the rank stampede.
- **Fix.** ROI is a device **window**: every rank charges + migrates ITSELF at
  its kernel-entry barrier (its own program order, no wall races), computes on
  its PE, migrates out at the closing barrier (later removed in 1.8.6/1.8.7);
  window close is a pure migration event. Migration bookkeeping serialized.
- **1.8.3 control surface.** Thread-based MPI rank emulation is the ONLY
  exec-method MPI model (`PIMID_MPI_THREADED` / `PIMID_MPI_PROCESS` deleted,
  legacy per-rank-process exec launcher removed -- per-rank processes remain
  only in the trace method); one knob `simulation.parallel` (default true)
  governs simulator parallelism for both APIs; MPI stays serial for
  determinism; `PIMID_EMIT_CONFIG_ONLY` honored in device scope.
- **Data impact.** Pre-1.8.4 co-sim MPI results measured a single rank / dev=0
  and must be regenerated. Known residuals at ship: deferred per-rank charges
  (fixed 1.8.5) and a nondeterministic post-measurement exit race (fixed 1.8.6).

## 1.8.2 -- defect #13: thread-MPI cycle rewind aborted every co-sim MPI run

- **Defect #13.** `ProcessStats::updateCore()` asserted a core's CYCLE counter
  is monotonic (`cCycles >= lastCoreCycles[cid]`). Under 1.6 thread-MPI it is
  not: a rank parking in a transport wait is rewound at `MPI_COMM_END`
  (`Core::pimidRewindCycles`) to erase wall-dependent wait growth and stay
  bit-exact, so the counter legitimately moves backwards -- the assert fired and
  QEMU took a SIGSEGV, killing every co-sim MPI cell (rc=1).
- **Root cause.** The cycle rewind (cycles-only; instruction count stays
  monotonic) collided with the cycle-monotonicity assert once a host domain and
  offload migration coexisted with real ranks -- first reachable only after
  1.8.0 stopped MPI running single-rank.
- **Fix.** Keep asserting INSTRUCTION monotonicity; mirror a cycle rollback in
  the process total instead of underflowing the unsigned subtraction.
- **Data impact.** Before 1.8.2 every co-sim MPI cell aborted (rc=1) with no
  output -- there is no pre-1.8.2 co-sim MPI data. This is the first release in
  which co-sim MPI ran correctly (16 ranks, no assert/SIGSEGV). Device scope
  unaffected (no host domain).

## 1.8.1 -- docs-only

Documentation for the 1.8.0 system-scope MPI + host-core fixes. No source
change; no data impact.

## 1.8.0 -- defect #12: system-scope MPI ran single-rank; host-baseline cores capped

- **Defect #12a -- host core count capped.** `host_num_cores` is parsed only
  from a top-level `host:` block, but system-scope configs declare the host
  under `system.hosts[]`, so it stayed at its default (4) -- capping OMP
  threads, MPI ranks, and the devorg `--pes` injection regardless of the
  configured count. Fix: sync it from the parsed HOST system node.
- **Defect #12b -- system-scope thread-MPI never wired.** The `libpimid_mpi.so`
  LD_PRELOAD plus `PIMID_MPI_RANKS`/`PIMID_MPI_THREADED` existed only in the
  device-scope branch, so every system-scope MPI run (host baselines AND co-sim)
  resolved MPI against the system runtime and executed as a SINGLE rank
  (rank 0, size 1) silently at exit 0. Fix: wire thread-MPI in system scope and
  force `parallelism=1` there (ranks run by zsim's deterministic round-robin
  core rotation, which never engages at parallelism>1).
- **Data impact.** System-scope MPI results produced before 1.8.0 are
  single-rank (and core-count-capped) and must be regenerated. Device-scope
  sweeps were never affected (device launch path; all edits gate on
  `scope == "system"`).
