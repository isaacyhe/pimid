# Changelog / defect ledger -- 1.8.0 -> 1.9.1

Release + defect ledger for the co-sim MPI window, the measured-feedback MPI
pricing model, and the OMP critical-path metric. One entry per release; each
gives the defect fixed, a one-line root cause, and a data-impact note (which
sweep generations the fix invalidates or corrects). Authoritative source is the
release commit messages; deeper design rationale for 1.9.0 is in
`docs-dev/DESIGN_190_PDES.md`.

## 1.9.1 -- docs-only

Documentation refresh for the 1.8.3 -> 1.9.0 train (this file, plus co-sim MPI
window, measured MPI pricing, and OMP critical-path metric edits). No source
change; no data impact.

## 1.9.0 -- measured Garnet-fed-back pricing for thread-MPI (epoch-frozen)

- **Change.** Thread-MPI per-access latency now prices from **measured** Garnet
  congestion via epoch-frozen deterministic feedback; the analytical override
  is demoted to an escape hatch (`PIMID_MPI_ANALYTICAL_PRICING=1`). OMP is
  unchanged (rolling-EWMA live feedback).
- **Root cause of what it replaces.** The naive "read the live per-drain EWMA"
  feedback was 26-196% per-core / ~25% makespan nondeterministic (a fast rank
  folds fewer drains into the rolling scalar than a slow one) and read-depth
  inflated. Epoch-frozen table lookup (read epoch `k-1`'s frozen sample, keyed
  by the access's own ROI-relative cycle) removes the read-instant dependence.
  Three membership leaks fixed en route (pre-ROI pollution, startup-skew
  stamping, partial-bucket folds; DESIGN_190 section 10), built on the
  already-deterministic per-phase batch contents (defect #9 venue-independence).
- **Repeatability reality (residual).** Not bit-exact: the one-pass
  measured-feedback loop converges to a **host-dependent fixpoint** --
  within-host <=0.15% typical per-core (occasional ~0.5%), cross-host 2-7%
  systematic; rank-0 / cut-pinning core host-independent to ~0.05%. Fidelity:
  measured level +5-12% above the analytical floor.
- **Data impact.** Thread-MPI detailed sweeps priced with the old analytical
  override should be **regenerated** with measured feedback. MPI sweeps must be
  run **single-venue** for internal consistency (true venue-independent
  bit-exactness needs two-pass replay, future work). OMP and analytical-model
  cells unaffected.

## 1.8.8 -- OMP critical-path cycle summary (core-0-metric defect)

- **Defect.** Device-scope OMP runs had no critical-path aggregation. Both the
  sweep harness (`grep cycles | head -1`) and `parseZSimOutputFile()` latched
  onto the FIRST per-PE `cycles:` line = **core 0 only**, which reflects only
  that PE's active cycles, not kernel completion (the last PE to finish).
- **Root cause.** Core 0 was a low outlier at 16/64 PEs but representative at 32
  (16 PEs: core0 8% low; 64 PEs: 26% low; 32 PEs: representative), so recording
  it manufactured a spurious bfs HBM3 32-PE +28% cycle spike that "reversed" at
  64.
- **Fix.** Device-scope OMP now emits `OMP cycles: <max> (mean, min, pes,
  critical-path max)` plus a parser-compatible `Total: <sum> cycles (max: <max>)`
  (mirroring the MPI path). Purely additive; per-PE lines / `out.cycles` /
  power untouched.
- **Data impact.** Device-scope OMP sweeps parsed via `head -1` / core-0 carry
  the artifact and must be re-parsed against `(max: N)` (or re-run). The results
  harness OMP branch must switch from `grep cycles | head -1` to the `(max: N)`
  line (flagged out-of-scope in the commit).

## 1.8.7 -- co-sim MPI: tid/cid aliasing, zero-migration ranks, guard, protocolTail

- **Defect #15 class -- tid/cid ROI-baseline aliasing.** `roiRelCycles(tid)`
  read the ROI baseline table by **rank id** while it is written by **core
  index**. In system scope a rank's `cid != tid`, so `tid` 0..3 aliased HOST
  cores' ~16.5M pre-ROI (MPI_Init-era) clock; `roiRel` clamped to 0 and
  collapsed the SEND/RECV rendezvous (reduce root accumulated senders' stamps
  instead of advancing to their max). Fix: index by the rank's actual core
  (`cids[tid]`) + a per-rank last-valid-cid cache. Scoped to co-sim; device
  scope keeps `tid` indexing (correct and deterministic there).
- **Finalized model.** Ranks ARE the device PEs; the post-ROI collective tail
  (closing barrier + Reduce + Finalize) is device-resident, executed and priced
  ON THE PE. **Zero migrations** at window close (the 1.8.4/1.8.6 residual
  device->host legs, incl. rank 0's `roi_end` migration, all removed), which
  also eliminates the 1.8.6 exit race by construction.
- **Cross-axis invariant guard (defect-13 / 1.7.7 tripwire lineage).** At the
  recv rendezvous, a single message advance exceeding the ROI span means the
  clock axes are mismatched -- shout and cap rather than advance by a garbage
  delta. Eliminated a rare ~4% `2^32` rendezvous overflow (Garnet "event too
  far into the future").
- **protocolTail stat.** Per-PE receipt (final PE cycles minus closing-barrier
  marker); visibility only, never alters `cycles`. Co-sim-only, fixed global
  array, so device-scope `Core`/`initStats` stay byte-identical.
- **Data impact.** System-scope (co-sim) MPI data produced before 1.8.7 has the
  collapsed rendezvous and must be regenerated; the flaky ~4% overflow is gone.
  Device-scope MPI unaffected (reproduces the 1.8.6 distribution).

## 1.8.6 -- co-sim MPI exit-protocol heap corruption

- **Defect.** The 1.8.4 closing device->host migrate-out freed a rank's core
  slot mid-handler while a peer immediately entered its contention-sim phase
  pass; under the MPI serial weave the two overlapping handlers iterated
  glibc-heap state unsynchronized and **corrupted the process heap** (the
  "malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk" / QEMU SIGSEGV / Garnet "No output port for
  vnet" panics, and rarely the contention_sim "event too far into the future"
  assert, all right after the last rank drained).
- **Root cause (exit race).** Racy closing migrate-out under
  `simulation.parallel` serial weave (one vcpu may touch simulator state, but a
  migrate-out + peer phase pass overlap). The mirror migrate-IN at window open
  never corrupts.
- **Fix.** Drop the closing migrate-out; the drained rank finishes its short
  post-ROI protocol on its device PE (<1% accounting shift).
- **Data impact.** Pre-1.8.6 co-sim MPI runs crashed non-deterministically
  (~1/6 clean); no trustworthy pre-1.8.6 co-sim MPI data. gemv checksum
  unchanged from 1.8.4; histogram checksum 512.

## 1.8.5 -- reinstate per-rank flush + launch charges in the co-sim MPI window

- **Fix.** Reinstated the per-rank flush + launch boundary charges that 1.8.4
  had deferred, so every rank prices flush + launch on its host core at its
  kernel-entry barrier.
- **Data impact.** Sub-0.05% at sweep scale; negligible.

## 1.8.4 -- defect #14 co-sim MPI ROI window (+ 1.8.3 control-surface tidy)

- **Defect #14 (four layers deep).** Co-sim MPI measured dev=0. Root cause
  spanned: rank-0-only `roi_begin`; a `ROI_BEGIN` thread-branch early-return
  skipping the offload block; a parked-opener wall-order race making
  window-open-time migration impossible; and non-thread-safe
  migration/termination under the rank stampede.
- **Fix.** ROI is a device **window**: every rank charges + migrates ITSELF at
  its kernel-entry barrier (its own program order, no wall races), computes on
  its PE, migrates out at the closing barrier (later removed in 1.8.6/1.8.7);
  window close is a pure migration event. Migration bookkeeping serialized.
- **1.8.3 control surface.** Thread-based MPI rank emulation is the ONLY
  exec-method MPI model (`PIMID_MPI_THREADED` / `PIMID_MPI_PROCESS` deleted,
  legacy per-rank-process exec launcher removed -- per-rank processes remain
  only in the trace method); one knob `simulation.parallel` (default true)
  governs simulator parallelism for both APIs; MPI stays serial for
  determinism; `PIMID_EMIT_CONFIG_ONLY` honored in device scope.
- **Data impact.** Pre-1.8.4 co-sim MPI results measured a single rank / dev=0
  and must be regenerated. Known residuals at ship: deferred per-rank charges
  (fixed 1.8.5) and a nondeterministic post-measurement exit race (fixed 1.8.6).

## 1.8.2 -- defect #13: thread-MPI cycle rewind aborted every co-sim MPI run

- **Defect #13.** `ProcessStats::updateCore()` asserted a core's CYCLE counter
  is monotonic (`cCycles >= lastCoreCycles[cid]`). Under 1.6 thread-MPI it is
  not: a rank parking in a transport wait is rewound at `MPI_COMM_END`
  (`Core::pimidRewindCycles`) to erase wall-dependent wait growth and stay
  bit-exact, so the counter legitimately moves backwards -- the assert fired and
  QEMU took a SIGSEGV, killing every co-sim MPI cell (rc=1).
- **Root cause.** The cycle rewind (cycles-only; instruction count stays
  monotonic) collided with the cycle-monotonicity assert once a host domain and
  offload migration coexisted with real ranks -- first reachable only after
  1.8.0 stopped MPI running single-rank.
- **Fix.** Keep asserting INSTRUCTION monotonicity; mirror a cycle rollback in
  the process total instead of underflowing the unsigned subtraction.
- **Data impact.** Before 1.8.2 every co-sim MPI cell aborted (rc=1) with no
  output -- there is no pre-1.8.2 co-sim MPI data. This is the first release in
  which co-sim MPI ran correctly (16 ranks, no assert/SIGSEGV). Device scope
  unaffected (no host domain).

## 1.8.1 -- docs-only

Documentation for the 1.8.0 system-scope MPI + host-core fixes. No source
change; no data impact.

## 1.8.0 -- defect #12: system-scope MPI ran single-rank; host-baseline cores capped

- **Defect #12a -- host core count capped.** `host_num_cores` is parsed only
  from a top-level `host:` block, but system-scope configs declare the host
  under `system.hosts[]`, so it stayed at its default (4) -- capping OMP
  threads, MPI ranks, and the devorg `--pes` injection regardless of the
  configured count. Fix: sync it from the parsed HOST system node.
- **Defect #12b -- system-scope thread-MPI never wired.** The `libpimid_mpi.so`
  LD_PRELOAD plus `PIMID_MPI_RANKS`/`PIMID_MPI_THREADED` existed only in the
  device-scope branch, so every system-scope MPI run (host baselines AND co-sim)
  resolved MPI against the system runtime and executed as a SINGLE rank
  (rank 0, size 1) silently at exit 0. Fix: wire thread-MPI in system scope and
  force `parallelism=1` there (ranks run by zsim's deterministic round-robin
  core rotation, which never engages at parallelism>1).
- **Data impact.** System-scope MPI results produced before 1.8.0 are
  single-rank (and core-count-capped) and must be regenerated. Device-scope
  sweeps were never affected (device launch path; all edits gate on
  `scope == "system"`).
