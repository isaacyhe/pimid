# PIMID Cache Warehouse

## What it is and why

Several PIMID backends produce their numbers by running a **slow, deterministic
design-space search**. NVSim characterization is the canonical example: given a
memory type, capacity, and process node, it searches cell/array organizations to
report read/write latency, energy, leakage, and area. The search can take on the
order of seconds per point and always returns the same answer for the same
inputs.

The **cache warehouse** memoizes those results. The first time a
`(backend, parameters)` point is needed it is computed and persisted; every later
run that asks for the same point reads it back instead of re-running the search.
Because the underlying computation is deterministic, the cache is safe: a hit is
indistinguishable from a fresh run except for being much faster.

The warehouse is *centralized* — one root directory shared across runs and
backends — so characterization work done by one experiment is reused by every
other.

## Cache modes

The cache behaves according to a **mode**:

| Mode  | Reads from cache | Writes to cache | Use when                                              |
|-------|:----------------:|:---------------:|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `rw`  | yes              | yes             | Default. Read if present, compute + store on a miss.  |
| `ro`  | yes              | no              | Reproduce results without mutating a shared warehouse.|
| `wo`  | no               | yes             | Force a recompute and **overwrite** the cached value. Use to refresh stale entries. |
| `off` | no               | no              | Bypass the cache entirely; always recompute, never store. |

Notes:

- `wo` ("write-only") still computes everything from scratch — it just skips the
  read so it always recomputes, and it stores the fresh result, superseding any
  previous one. This is the mode to use when refreshing entries flagged by
  `pimid-cache stale`.
- `off` is equivalent to having no warehouse at all for that run.

## Configuration surfaces and precedence

The cache mode and warehouse location can be set three ways. **Precedence,
highest first: CLI > environment > YAML config > built-in default.**

1. **CLI flags**
   - `--cache <mode>` — one of `rw`, `ro`, `wo`, `off`.
   - `--cache-dir <path>` — warehouse root.

2. **Environment variables**
   - `PIMID_CACHE_MODE` — `rw` | `ro` | `wo` | `off`.
   - `PIMID_CACHE_DIR` — warehouse root.
   - `PIMID_CACHE_DISABLE` — if set to a truthy value, forces the cache off
     (equivalent to `--cache off`).

3. **YAML config**
   ```yaml
   cache:
     mode: rw          # rw | ro | wo | off
     dir: ~/.cache/pimid
     enabled: true     # false is equivalent to mode: off
   ```

4. **Defaults**
   - mode: `rw`
   - dir: `~/.cache/pimid`

### Back-compat

The previous, NVSim-specific environment variables are still honored:

- `PIMID_NVSIM_CACHE_DIR` — legacy location of the NVSim cache. The warehouse
  treats its **parent directory** as the warehouse root (the legacy dir was the
  per-backend `nvsim/` subdir). Honored only when the generic
  `PIMID_CACHE_DIR` is unset.
- `PIMID_NVSIM_CACHE_DISABLE` — legacy disable switch, treated like
  `PIMID_CACHE_DISABLE`.

The generic `PIMID_CACHE_*` variables take precedence over the legacy
`PIMID_NVSIM_*` ones.

## On-disk layout

```
<root>/                       warehouse root (default ~/.cache/pimid)
├── index.jsonl               append-only manifest (one JSON object per line)
├── nvsim/                     per-backend artifact subdir
│   ├── nvm_t1_c8388608_n22.xml
│   └── ...
└── <other-backend>/          one subdir per backend
```

### Manifest: `index.jsonl`

The manifest is **append-only**: one JSON object per line, never rewritten in
place by normal runs. Each record describes one cached point:

```json
{
  "backend": "nvsim",
  "key": "t1_c8388608_n22",
  "tool_version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": 1780000000,
  "params": {
    "nvm_type": 1,
    "capacity_bytes": 8388608,
    "process_node_nm": 22
  },
  "value": {
    "read_latency_s": 1.2e-9,
    "write_latency_s": 3.4e-9,
    "read_energy_nj": 0.1,
    "write_energy_nj": 0.2,
    "leakage_mw": 5.0,
    "area_mm2": 0.05
  }
}
```

Field meanings:

| Field          | Meaning                                                              |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `backend`      | Backend that produced the record (e.g. `nvsim`); also its subdir.   |
| `key`          | Stable identity of the cached point within the backend.             |
| `tool_version` | Version of the producing tool; used to detect stale entries.        |
| `timestamp`    | Unix epoch seconds when the record was written.                     |
| `params`       | Input parameters that define the point.                             |
| `value`        | The cached result.                                                  |

Because the manifest is append-only, the **same `(backend, key)` may appear on
several lines**. The line with the highest `timestamp` (equivalently, the last
occurrence) is **authoritative**; earlier lines are superseded history. The
`pimid-cache prune` command compacts this history.

## The `pimid-cache` tool

A standalone Python 3 (stdlib-only) inspector/maintenance CLI lives at
`scripts/pimid-cache`. It resolves the warehouse root using
`--dir`/`--cache-dir` > `$PIMID_CACHE_DIR` > (legacy parent of
`$PIMID_NVSIM_CACHE_DIR`) > `~/.cache/pimid`.

### Subcommands

- `pimid-cache path` — print the resolved root and manifest path.
- `pimid-cache list [--backend B]` — table of unique `(backend, key)` entries
  (latest each): backend, key, tool_version, human timestamp, key params.
- `pimid-cache show <key> [--backend B]` — pretty-printed full latest record.
- `pimid-cache stale [--current-version X] [--backend B]` — entries whose
  `tool_version` differs from the current version (default `1.0.0`). These are
  refresh candidates — re-run them with `--cache wo`.
- `pimid-cache prune [--dry-run] [--force] [--stale] [--backend B] [--current-version X]`
  — compact the manifest by removing superseded/duplicate (and malformed) lines,
  keeping the latest line per key. With `--stale`, also drop entries whose
  version mismatches and delete their artifact files when locatable. **Defaults
  to a dry run**; pass `--force` to actually apply. All operations are confined
  to the resolved warehouse root.

The `--dir`/`--cache-dir` option is global and may appear before the subcommand.

### Examples

```bash
# Where is the warehouse?
pimid-cache path

# What's cached?
pimid-cache list
pimid-cache list --backend nvsim

# Inspect one point.
pimid-cache show t1_c8388608_n22

# Find entries produced by an old tool version.
pimid-cache stale
pimid-cache stale --current-version 1.1.0

# Refresh a stale point (recompute + overwrite):
#   re-run the relevant PIMID experiment with:  --cache wo

# See what compaction would do, then apply it.
pimid-cache prune                 # dry-run: superseded/duplicate/malformed lines
pimid-cache prune --force         # apply

# Also evict stale entries and their artifacts.
pimid-cache prune --stale                 # dry-run
pimid-cache prune --stale --force         # apply

# Operate on a non-default warehouse.
pimid-cache --dir /scratch/pimid-cache list
PIMID_CACHE_DIR=/scratch/pimid-cache pimid-cache list
```

A missing or empty warehouse is handled gracefully — the tool prints a
"warehouse empty / not found" notice rather than crashing, and malformed
manifest lines are skipped with a warning.
