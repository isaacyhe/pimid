/* PIMID 1.11.40 -- harness for CACTI-IO (external/cacti/extio.cc).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The link surface was a table of DERIVED numbers: 7.0 pJ/bit,
 * 63.0 GB/s, 500 ns per transaction, and "UCIe PHY area is not sourceable".
 * Each was a single value standing where a model belongs. CACTI-IO is an
 * off-chip IO model that computes termination power, PHY static and dynamic
 * power, IO area and timing/voltage margin from EXTRACTED PARAMETERS -- swing
 * voltages, capacitances, bias and leakage currents, termination resistances,
 * and area coefficients as a polynomial in impedance and frequency. It has been
 * vendored in this tree, compiled into the CACTI library, and called by nothing.
 *
 * WHAT IT COVERS -- MEASURED, not assumed (gate 1155, audit N8). CACTI-IO's
 * Mem_IO_type spans DDR3, DDR4, LPDDR2, WideIO, Low_Swing_Diff and Serial. We
 * ran all of them:
 *
 *   DRAM-CLASS PATHS: USABLE. DDR4-3200 x64 gives IO area 2.99 mm^2,
 *   termination 262 mW, dynamic 443 mW, PHY 390 mW -- about 1.1 W, physical.
 *   This is the model's home and the reason to harness it: it replaces the
 *   hand-written SSTL/POD/LVSTL scheme table in pimid_energy.h and adds PHY
 *   power and IO area, which PIMID does not model at all.
 *
 *   SERIAL PATH: NOT USABLE, and it had never been executed by anyone. Four
 *   independent faults, all upstream: (1) nothing called it; (2) the Serial
 *   branch declared r_diff_term and left rtt1/rtt2_dq_*, rs1/rs2_dq, rtt_ca,
 *   r_stub_ca, z0, r_on and t_flight at ZERO, so rpar_write divided by zero --
 *   SIGFPE on construction; (3) num_mem_clk divides by (num_clk/2) and a
 *   serial link legitimately has num_clk = 0 (embedded clock, CDR), so integer
 *   0/2 faults; (4) the area polynomial is a FIT over DDR frequencies -- its
 *   cubic term is 0.003 at 800 MHz and 163.8 at 32 GHz, yielding 61 mm^2 of IO
 *   area for 16 lanes, and even at 8 GT/s the termination power returns
 *   3.97e+280 mW (uninitialised memory).
 *   1.11.40 repaired (2) and (3) in our fork so the path constructs, and
 *   REFUSED above 8000 MHz rather than extrapolating the cubic. It did NOT
 *   repair (4): refitting coefficients for multi-GHz serial rates cannot be
 *   done from published bands alone.
 *
 * 1.11.57 (latent C024, and C009 with it): the serial entry point
 * computeLink() is DELETED -- declaration and body both. What it was: a
 * public, compiled, documented function with NO caller anywhere in src/,
 * include/ or tools/ (verified tree-wide; linkBandwidthGBs() and
 * linkRateGTs() are equally uncalled but are pure specification lookups and
 * stay). It was invisible for exactly that reason: a wrong number that
 * nothing asks for cannot appear in a report. It was not, however, harmless
 * to keep. Its 8000 MHz fit guard admitted exactly ONE of the seven link
 * types this file knows (pcie_gen3 at 8.0 GT/s lands on the ceiling
 * precisely; gen4/gen5/cxl/interposer/nvlink/ualink are all refused), so
 * anyone wiring it up would have found six refusals and one answer -- and
 * that one answer is fault (4) above, a termination power of 3.97e+280 mW
 * returned with valid = true and an energy_pj_per_bit derived from it. A
 * caller taking the valid flag at face value would have priced a link from
 * uninitialised memory.
 *
 * The same deletion retires the C009 claim, which lived inside it. Those two
 * lines set ron_value = 50 and rtt_value = 50 ohm and called them
 * "specification facts about the electrical layer -- the one kind of single
 * value that is legitimately a constant", naming no specification. Nothing in
 * this tree supports that: no PCIe electrical document is under misc/ (which
 * holds the JEDEC set the DRAM table cites -- JESD79-3D, JESD8-24, JESD8-21C,
 * JESD250D -- and no PCI-SIG material), and the only other 50 in the path is
 * upstream's own untraceable default, extio_technology.cc:874
 * `r_on = (g_ip->ron_value > 0.0) ? g_ip->ron_value : 50;`. 50/50 ohm
 * single-ended is a widespread convention for a 100 ohm differential channel;
 * it is not a fact this tree can cite, and we do not invent a citation for it.
 * Note also that the Serial branch hardcodes rtt1_dq_read = 50 and never
 * reads g_ip->rtt_value, so half the assertion was inert even when executed.
 *
 * If a serial link model is wanted later, it starts from DSENT or from a
 * refit of the area polynomial -- not from reviving this function.
 *
 * So PCIe/CXL link energy stays on the 1.11.40 published bands, labelled as
 * literature values rather than model output. DSENT is the candidate model for
 * that class and is not vendored.
 *
 * VALIDATION TARGET. The published bands (PCIe gen5 7.6-11.4 pJ/bit; UCIe
 * advanced 0.25-0.5) are the test set for whatever model eventually covers
 * serial links -- not the model itself.
 *
 * GLOBAL-STATE DISCIPLINE (audit E30, and 1.11.45's correction of it).
 * CACTI-IO reads g_ip -- num_dq, num_dqs, num_ca, num_clk, duty_cycle,
 * io_type, iostate -- the same global CACTIWrapper and the McPAT fork also
 * use, and E30 records that CACTIWrapper leaves it dangling.
 *
 * 1.11.56 (audit C025): this paragraph used to describe the SAVE/MUTATE/
 * RESTORE pattern ("SAVES the whole InputParameter ... and RESTORES it") --
 * that is exactly the pattern 1.11.45 removed, and the .cpp calls it a
 * use-after-free: saving *g_ip and later writing *g_ip = saved is a write
 * THROUGH whatever the global points at, which after any CACTIWrapper's
 * death is freed memory (a dangling pointer is not null, so a null check
 * cannot save you). Leaving the retired pattern documented in the header as
 * the discipline is how it gets reintroduced.
 *
 * What the implementation ACTUALLY does is a POINTER SWAP: each entry point
 * points g_ip at its own function-static InputParameter for the duration of
 * the call, resets that object to defaults, fills the IO fields, and on every
 * exit path restores the PREVIOUS POINTER -- dereferencing nothing it does
 * not own.
