    /* Energy modeling.
     *
     * 1.11.57 (latent D043): THESE FOUR HAVE NO AGREED UNITS TODAY, and the
     * interface said nothing, so a consumer holding a MemoryModel* could not
     * know what it was being handed. The three bases actually in the tree:
     *   SRAMModel        getReadEnergy() = nJ PER ACCESS (CACTI's
     *                    getDynamicReadEnergy)
     *   DRAMModel        getReadEnergy() = CUMULATIVE nJ over all accesses so
     *                    far (total_reads_ x per-access)
     *   STTMRAM/PCM/ReRAM getReadEnergy() = pJ PER BYTE (the architecture
     *                    object's read_energy_per_byte; their own printStats
     *                    label it " pJ/byte")
     * Three quantities, one signature: per-access energy, an accumulating
     * total, and an energy density differing by the access size and by 1000.
     * The single consumer that flattens them,
     * CompositePowerModel::estimatePower, reads all three as "nJ per access"
     * -- so an NVM device's read energy would be understated by 1000x and a
     * DRAM device's would grow without bound as the run proceeded.
     *
     * WHY NOTHING IS WRONG TODAY: CompositePowerModel is never constructed
     * (nothing calls addMemoryModel()), and no other caller reads these four
     * through the base class. The reported memory energy comes from the
     * RamulatorWrapper/CACTI/NVSim paths directly.
     *
     * THE CONTRACT, stated here so the next implementation has one to follow:
     * getReadEnergy()/getWriteEnergy() are NANOJOULES PER ACCESS at the
     * model's configured access width, getLeakagePower() is WATTS, and
     * getTotalEnergy() is NANOJOULES accumulated since the last resetStats().
     * 1.11.58: THE FOUR IMPLEMENTATIONS NOW OBEY IT. This was the gated
     * change this paragraph asked for. What was wrong: the three NVM models
     * assigned read_energy_/write_energy_ from TWO different units depending
     * on which path ran -- pJ per byte from the architecture object, nJ per
     * access from NVSim -- so the field's meaning depended on whether a
     * characterization was available; and all four added a JOULES leakage
     * term to a picojoule or nanojoule dynamic sum, then returned the result
     * under this header's nanojoule contract. Members are normalised to
     * nJ/access at assignment and getTotalEnergy() returns nanojoules.
     * A polymorphic consumer is now safe.
     *
     * 1.11.60 (audit round 4, C003): THAT LAST SENTENCE WAS PREMATURE, and it
     * is true now. 1.11.58 changed two of the three quantities this paragraph
     * lists -- the NVM density and the leakage unit -- and declared the third,
     * DRAMModel's accumulating total, closed along with them. It was not:
     * DRAMModel::getReadEnergy() still returned the wrapper's cumulative
     * total_reads_ x per-access, copied in on every tick(), and its
     * resetStats() zeroed it, which is accumulating-total behaviour and not
     * per-access behaviour. So the contract paragraph asserted a property of
     * an implementation that did not hold it, which is worse than the original
     * silence: a reader who trusted this text would have had DRAM's read
     * energy grow without bound while the three NVM models returned a
     * constant. DRAMModel now takes the wrapper's INTENSIVE
     * getArrayReadEnergyNJ()/getArrayWriteEnergyNJ() and does its own
     * accumulation inside getTotalEnergy(). All four obey; the claim is
     * checked against each of the four rather than inferred from the release
     * that changed two of them. */

    // Every model already resolved subarray/bank/chip, but under different
    // names and arities: getSubarrayAccessLatency (DRAM) vs
    // getSubarrayReadLatency (SRAM/NVM), and PCM alone carries SET/RESET.
    // That divergence is why the factory was never wired: main.cpp could not
    // ask a MemoryModel for a placement latency without knowing which
    // technology it was talking to -- which defeats the point of a factory.
    //
    // One query, technology-agnostic. Adding a memory technology becomes
    // "implement this contract and bind your tool"; no main.cpp edit.
    //
    // hasTier() is load-bearing, not decoration: SRAM and NVM are NOT
    // DRAM-like. Bank groups and ranks collapse to 1 for them and no
    // architecture header even declares those fields, so a tier that does not
    // exist must be REPORTABLE AS ABSENT rather than silently collapsed onto
    // its neighbour or invented from a multiplier. That invention is exactly
    // what 1.11.23 found and removed.
    //
    // latencySourceNs() returns the provenance of the number, per tier and
    // per operation. A model that cannot source a tier returns a negative
    // latency and a reason; callers REFUSE rather than substitute. This is
    // the vendorArrayFraction() discipline applied to timing.
