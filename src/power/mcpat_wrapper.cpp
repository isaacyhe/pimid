/* 1.11.21 (user rulings E1+E2): the DRAM-periphery family factors are all

 *
 *   fa = l_phy(comm-dram) / l_phy(base)
 *        22nm hp 2.4444 (was 2.44)      32nm hp 2.4615 (was 2.46)

 *        22nm hp 0.8241 (was 0.82)      32nm hp 0.6646 (was 0.66)
 *        The Vdd^2 term is NOT a double count: applyFam multiplies McPAT's
 *        already-computed dynamic (processor.cc:443), and McPAT computed it
 *        at the BASE column's Vdd, so the conversion to the comm-dram rail
 *        has to happen here.
 *   fl = [I_off_n(cd,T) / I_off_n(base,T)] * (Vdd_cd/Vdd_base)
 *        22nm hp @50C 1.035e-5 (was 1.0e-5)   32nm hp @50C 3.119e-6 (was 3.1e-6)
 *
 * TEMPERATURE, and a defect the derivation exposed: the leakage literals
 * reproduce the table at 50 C, but temperature_k defaults to 350 K = 77 C and
 * that is what every run configures. Leakage is strongly temperature
 * dependent -- at 22nm the derived factor is 1.035e-5 at 50 C and 7.0e-6 at
 * 70 C, a 30% difference -- so the shipped constant was evaluated at a
 * temperature no run uses. fl now reads the row for the CONFIGURED
 * temperature, snapped to the nearest tabulated 10 C step.
 *
 * BASELINE, and the corner axis (E2): for a DRAM-periphery component the
 * low-power device is lp-dram, NOT logic lstp -- the low-power variant of a
 * DRAM periphery transistor is the one the DRAM table carries. So on a
 * periphery placement power.device_corner maps hp -> hp and lstp|lop ->
 * lp-dram. That column is ALL ZERO at 22 nm and fully populated at 32/45 nm,
 * so the refusal is a populated-column CHECK per node, not a blanket rule
 * justified by a 22 nm-only fact. */
/* 1.11.22: the ratio spans TWO tables, and both ends are now named.
 *
 * 1.11.21 derived the factors but read numerator AND denominator from the

 * tech_node_nm (the logic node), while dram_table_nm comes from the memory
 * TECHNOLOGY (DDR3 -> 32, everything else -> 22). When they differ, the
 * denominator was hp at the DRAM table's node while McPAT had priced at hp of
 * the logic node -- l_phy(hp) is 0.009 at 22 nm and 0.013 at 32 nm, so the
 * product was neither node's comm-dram. Same defect class as E1, one level
 * up: a within-table ratio multiplied across tables.
 *
 * Inert for the current corpus (non-DDR3 maps to 22 and the fleet runs
 * tech_node_nm=22, so the tables coincide and it cancels). It bites DDR3 at
 * any node, and every technology at a non-22 nm logic node -- both of which
 * the 300-cell fleet contains.

     * 1.11.16 (verification audit) -- three corrections here.
     * (1) The interpolation runs on SUBTHRESHOLD leakage only. The gated
     *     endpoint is a subthreshold quantity (every McPAT producer derives
     *     it from power.readOp.leakage alone), while the old active side
     *     used sub+gate: the bases differed by the gate-leakage share, and
     *     gate-oxide tunnelling -- which a sleep rail does NOT remove -- was
     *     credited with PG savings. Gate leakage now stays at its active
     *     value.
     * (2) The 1.11.15 comment claimed savings were CONSERVATIVE because
     *     blocks without sleep-tx models "keep active leakage". They kept
     *     ZERO (the dead-endpoint defect, fixed in array.cc this release),
     *     which is anti-conservative; with the uniform analytic endpoint the
     *     residual is Vcc_min/Vdd (~0.35) of active, McPAT's own retention
     *     floor.
     * (3) Diagnostics go to STDERR: extractResults runs in the forked child
     *     whose stdout is /dev/null, so the 1.11.15 inversion warning was
     *     unreachable. The check is also two-sided now -- a near-zero gated

         * BBL terminates at a control transfer -- true for a real
         * multi-instruction basic block, but on this QEMU-fed decode path a BBL
         * averages ~1.09 instructions, so bbls ~= instrs and the "measured"
         * branch rate came out at 91.5%. The in-order core always exported a
         * real `branches` counter; the OOO core ran a predictor but exported
         * only its MISSES, so 1.9.33 added the total there too. Both cores now
         * report it, and both report it ROI-windowed like instrs.
         * The integer/floating split is still an assumption (zsim does not
         * classify retired ops), but it is now applied to the NON-branch
         * remainder instead of to the whole stream, so a branch-heavy workload

         *
         * 1.9.29 CORRECTION -- 1.9.28 SHIPPED THIS WITHOUT CHECKING THE BASES.
         * The activity counters and the instruction count are NOT on the same
         * base. Measured on a co-simulation dump: instrs 52,093 against uops
         * 4,247,062, bbls 649,332 and branches 580,744 -- every activity counter
         * is 10-80x the instruction count it is supposed to be a fraction of.
         * The consequence was a degenerate mix: the co-simulation host was
         * described to the power model as 91.5% branches, and the device-scope
         * path (added in 1.9.29) hit the clamp below and was described as 100%
         * branches with zero integer and zero floating-point operations. That is
         * worse than the fixed fractions it replaced -- 1.9.28 exchanged an
         * invented-but-plausible mix for a measured-but-impossible one, and the
         * A/B did not catch it because a degenerate mix barely moves the total.
         *
         * WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A CORRECTION: scaling counters on
         * different bases by a factor chosen to make the ratio look right
         * would be exactly the class of invented constant this release train

         * 1.11.42 STATUS (audit E22 closure): the base mismatch described

         * base (co-sim host measures instrs=10 against uops=11, consistent),
         * and across 75 recent gate-run logs the rejection path is never
         * taken: every run prints "instruction mix COUNTED". Both co-sim
         * nodes count from their own real decoded traces (device:
