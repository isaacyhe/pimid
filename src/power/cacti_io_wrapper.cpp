 * WHAT WAS WRONG. Two defects sat on top of each other. C024: the fit-range
 * guard a few lines into the body (`freq_mhz > 8000.0` REFUSE) admitted
 * exactly ONE of the seven link types specFor() knows -- pcie_gen3's 8.0 GT/s
 * becomes 8000 MHz and lands on the ceiling exactly, while gen4 (16000),
 * gen5/cxl (32000), interposer (16000), nvlink (25000) and ualink (200000)
 * were all refused. And the single case that survived is the one the header
 * records as returning a termination power of 3.97e+280 mW out of
 * uninitialised memory -- reported with `valid = true` and an
 * `energy_pj_per_bit` computed from it. C009: the body asserted
 * ron_value = 50 and rtt_value = 50 ohm as "specification facts about the
 * electrical layer" while naming no specification, in a file whose DRAM half
 * cites JESD79-3D, JESD8-24 and JESD8-21C by clause. There is no PCIe
 * electrical document in this tree to cite (misc/ holds the JEDEC set and no
 * PCI-SIG material), and the only companion 50 is upstream's own
 * untraceable default at extio_technology.cc:874. The Serial branch also
 * hardcodes rtt1_dq_read = 50 and never reads g_ip->rtt_value, so the rtt
 * half of the claim did nothing even when the code ran.
 *
 * WHY IT WAS INVISIBLE. Nothing called it. A tree-wide grep over src/,
 * include/ and tools/ finds the definition and the declaration and no third
 * site; the only CactiIOWrapper entry points with live callers are
 * linkControllerClockMHz() (main.cpp) and computeDramIO()/dramRateMTs()/
 * dramChannelWidthBits() (src/memory/ramulator_wrapper.cpp). A number nothing
 * asks for cannot reach a report -- which is precisely why both defects could
 * sit here compiled and documented. Deleting is the fix that makes the trap
 * unrepeatable: repairing the prose would have left a one-link entry point
 * whose one answer is uninitialised memory, waiting for a caller.
 *
 * linkBandwidthGBs() and linkRateGTs() are equally uncalled and are KEPT:
 * they return specification primitives with no model behind them, so an
 * unused lookup is not a trap. */

/* PIMID'S OWN SOURCED ELECTRICAL LAYER, injected into CACTI-IO.
 *
 * CACTI-IO carries one electrical set per io_type, so DDR5/LPDDR5/GDDR6/HBM had
 * to borrow a neighbour's rail voltage and termination -- which is why they were
 * cross-check-only. PIMID already holds these values, sourced, in
 * pimid_energy.h: VDDQ, RTT and RON cited to JESD79-3-1 + T38/T41 (DDR3L
 * SSTL-135, RZQ=240 so RTT=RZQ/6, RON=RZQ/7 -- 1.11.57 audit C008: this line
 * said SSTL-15, naming the 1.5 V part while pimid_energy.h prices the 1.35 V
 * one), JESD8-24 POD12 (DDR4), POD11 (DDR5),
 * JESD8-21C POD135 (GDDR6, RTT programmable via MR1), and the Micron LPDDR5
 * datasheets (LVSTL, VDDQ 0.5 V ODT-on, RON 40).
 *
 * Injecting them and re-deriving the swings is strictly better than borrowing:
 * LPDDR5's 0.5 V rail against LPDDR2's enters every swing as V^2, which is the
 * single biggest error in the borrowed configuration.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL BORROWED, and must stay stated: capacitances, bias and leakage
 * currents, PHY coefficients and the area polynomial remain CACTI-IO's family
 * values. PIMID has no sourced replacement for those. So an injected technology
 * is better-grounded than a borrowed one but is not fully sourced, and it says
 * so in `source`.
 *
 * RTT for LPDDR5 is the one UNSOURCED input, flagged the same way pimid_energy.h
 * flags it: Micron defers the ohm table to a separate AC/DC document we do not
 * have, so 240 (RZQ, the LPDDR4/5 ODT reference) stands in.
 *
 * 1.11.59 (LPDDR5 IO sourcing): THE SEARCH FOR THAT OHM TABLE WAS RUN OVER THE
 * WHOLE misc/ ARCHIVE AND IT IS NOT THERE. Recorded so the next worker does
 * not repeat it. What IS in hand, and what is not:
 *
 *   VDDQ = 0.50 V   SOURCED. "VDDQ = 0.50V or 0.45V TYP; 0.30V TYP (ODT off
 *                   only)" -- misc/315b-441b-561b-563b-y52p-*-lpddr5x.pdf p.1
 *                   Features, "Ultra-low-voltage core and I/O power supplies";
 *                   same line as "VDDQ = 0.5V NOM or 0.3V NOM (ODT off)" in
 *                   misc/Micron_LPDDR5_MT62F_datasheet.pdf p.1. The IDD table
 *                   header states the operating range VDDQ = 0.47-0.57 V
 *                   (same file, Table 7, p.14).
 *   RON  = 40 ohm   SOURCED. IDD-table Note 4, verbatim: "IDD4RQ value is
 *                   reference only. Typical value. Output load = 5pF; RON = 40
 *                   ohms; TC = 25 C" -- misc/Micron_LPDDR5_MT62F_datasheet.pdf

 *                   MICT-S-A0025741931-1 p.30 and y4bm p.25.
 *   RTT             NOT FOUND, still. Every Micron part sheet states only
 *                   "Programmable VSS on-die termination (ODT)" (Features,
 *                   p.1) and defers the ohm table to "General LPDDR5/LPDDR5X
 *                   Specification 2", which misc/ does not hold; JESD209-5 is
 *                   not in misc/ either; and there is no LVSTL document in the
 *                   JESD8-* set we have (JESD8-19 POD18, -20A POD15, -21C
 *                   POD135, -23 wide-range CMOS, -24 POD12, -25 POD10).
 *                   The 240 ohm on the ZQ pin is NOT this number: it is the
 *                   external calibration reference ("The ZQ pin should be
 *                   connected to VDDQ through a 240 ohm +-1% resistor",
 *                   y52p Table 11, p.22).
 *
 * THE ONE SOURCED THING WE NOW HAVE ABOUT RTT IS A BOUND, NOT A VALUE.
 * misc/743844-015.pdf (Intel doc 743844 rev 015, cl.13.2.2.4 Table 89,
 * "LPDDR5/x Signal Group DC Specifications", p.211) gives the HOST-side
 * buffer: RODT(DQ) "On-die termination equivalent resistance for data
 * signals" Minimum 30, Maximum 240 ohm, TYPICAL COLUMN EMPTY; and RON_UP(DQ)
 * / RON_DN(DQ) Minimum 30, Maximum 50 ohm (which brackets Micron's 40).
 * Two reasons that does not close this: it is the CONTROLLER's termination,
 * not the DRAM's, and 30-240 is a range with no centre. What it does buy is
 * a direction: the 240 in use is the MAXIMUM of the documented range, i.e.
 * the weakest termination and so the LOWEST termination energy the range
 * allows -- the 30 ohm end would raise it about 4x (a 280 ohm loop against
 * 70). So the standing assumption is not merely unsourced, it sits at the
 * optimistic end of the only bound we can cite. It is left in place and left
 * sourced = false: an endpoint of a host-side range is not a device value,
 * and flipping the gate on it would let an assumption replace the reported
 * termination energy, which is exactly what C020 stopped. */

     * 3200 MT/s, and the result came back with valid = true, exact_map set
     * from the technology's own map, and a `source` string naming the
     * technology the caller asked about. An HBM3 request with a missing rate
     * would have been answered as if it were DDR4-3200 -- and every consumer
     * of this result (termination energy, interface dynamic energy, IO area,
     * and the pJ/bit derived from all three) would have been priced off a
     * geometry nobody chose. num_dq is the channel's DATA-BUS WIDTH: it sets
     * the DQ pin count, and through the n_dqs/n_ca derivation below it also
     * sets the strobe and command-bus pin counts, so it governs every
     * per-pin term in the model as well as the denominator of the pJ/bit.
     * rate_mts is the transfer rate: bus_freq is rate_mts/2, which governs
     * dynamic power, the PHY terms, and which side of the 3162 MHz area
     * crossover and the 8000 MHz fit ceiling the evaluation falls on.
     *
     * Why it was invisible: no reachable caller can trigger it. All three
     * computeDramIO() call sites (src/memory/ramulator_wrapper.cpp) build
     * their arguments from dramRateMTs()/dramChannelWidthBits() above, both
     * of which return the standard's value for every technology they accept
     * and a negative for the rest, and then guard on them (e.g. `if (rate <=
     * 0.0 || ndq <= 0) return 0.0;`) before calling. So the substitution has
     * never fired. It stays as a guard rather than becoming a refusal because
     * dividing by a zero width downstream is worse than a stated default --
