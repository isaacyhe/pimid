 * size in bytes -- 8x at this model's 64-bit default.
 *
 * The consumers want per-access energy, so the arithmetic multiplies the
 * density back by the same bytes-per-access the extractor divided by, which
 * recovers the bank energy exactly instead of approximating it. The width must
 * come from access_width_bits_ for that identity to hold, since
 * initializeNVSim() is what hands it to NVSim; "0 = model default" is the
 * 64 bits initializeNVSim() substitutes.
 *
 * WHY IT WAS INVISIBLE: getTotalEnergy() and printStats() have no reachable
 * caller, and access() -- the only thing that increments the counters -- is
 * never called either, so the product was 0 * wrong.
 *
