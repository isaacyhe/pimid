 * @brief DRAM Internal Datapath Structure
 *
 * DRAM has multiple datapath stages with DIFFERENT widths:
 *
 * Stage 1: Row Buffer (Bitline Sense Amps)
 *   - DDR4: 8,192 bits (8Kb) per subarray [VERIFIED: typical]
 *   - Activated row sits in bitline sense amplifiers
 *
 * Stage 2: Global Sense Amplifiers (GSA)
 *   - DDR4 x8: 256 bits per subarray [INFERRED: from DAS-MICRO15]
 *   - Reads data from row buffer to peripheral circuitry
 *
 * Stage 3: Prefetch Datapath
 *   - DDR4 x8: 64 bits (8n prefetch x 8-bit I/O) [VERIFIED: JEDEC]
 *   - DDR5 x8: 128 bits (16n prefetch x 8-bit I/O) [VERIFIED: JEDEC]
 *   - HBM2: 256 bits (2n x 128-bit channel) [VERIFIED: JEDEC]
 *   - HBM3: 512 bits (8n x 64-bit channel) [VERIFIED: JEDEC]
 *
 * Stage 4: Bank-to-Peripheral Serialization
 *   - UNKNOWN! Not publicly documented.
 *   - Likely narrow (8-32 bits) to save routing area [ESTIMATED]
 *   - THIS IS THE CRITICAL BOTTLENECK FOR BANK-LEVEL PIM!
 *
 * Stage 5: Chip I/O Pins
 *   - DDR4: x4/x8/x16 (4, 8, or 16 bits) [VERIFIED: JEDEC]
 *   - HBM2: 1024 bits total (8 x 128-bit channels) [VERIFIED: JEDEC]
 *   - HBM3: 1024 bits total (16 x 64-bit channels) [VERIFIED: JEDEC]

 * @brief Infer internal port widths from MEASURED bandwidth
 *
 * Since internal port widths are not documented, we can INFER limits
 * from measured bandwidth characteristics.
 *
 * METHODOLOGY:
 * If Bank-PIM achieves only X GB/s despite Y banks in parallel,
 * we can infer each bank's internal port is limited to ~X/Y GB/s.
 *
 * CONSERVATIVE: We use LOWER BOUNDS (worst case for PIM)

/* 1.11.57 (audit C003): the three STORED bandwidths are GONE from this struct.
 *
 * What was wrong: bank_effective_bw_GBs and bank_group_effective_bw_GBs were
 * frozen literals per technology while every other rung of the same ladder is
 * a width times a clock (getSubarrayBandwidth uses clock_freq_mhz;
 * getChipIOBandwidth / getRankBW / getChannelBandwidth use data_rate_mtps).
 * They matched only the clocks the factories carried before 1.11.56 re-binned
 * HBM2, DDR5 and HBM3, and nothing re-derived them.
 *
 * Why it was invisible: the ladder builder turns a rung into a CLOCK by
 * f = BW * 8 / width, so a stale bandwidth does not show up as a bandwidth --
 * it shows up as a frequency, and the comment at that site claimed the
 * arithmetic "lands on the core clock for the array tiers". Worked through,
 * HBM3's bank tier came out at 16.0 * 8 / 128 = 1.0 GHz against its own
 * 3.2 GHz core clock, so every L1 and L2 crossing on the reference cell was
 * charged 3.2x the time this object's own width and clock imply (DDR5: 0.67x).
 * Only DDR4 was self-consistent, which is exactly why it never looked wrong.
 *
 * The fix derives both rungs the way the neighbours are derived, from fields
 * this object already carries, so a speed-bin change moves them and no
 * per-technology bandwidth number is invented anywhere. chip_internal_bw_GBs
 * went with them: it had no reader at all and its literals (DDR4 4.8 against
 * chip I/O 8 bits x 2400 MT/s = 2.4) were a second authority waiting to be
 * believed. See getBankEffectiveBW() / getBankGroupEffectiveBW(). */

         *   pages_per_unit, hence --pages-per-unit and the emitted
         *   pagesPerUnit, hence the address-to-unit map and PE locality.
         *
         * chip_size_mb -- THE UNIT DIFFERS BY FAMILY, deliberately, because
         * the two families do not have the same thing to count:
         *   DDR3/DDR4/DDR5/LPDDR5/GDDR6: ONE DEVICE. Equal to the preset's
         *     device density (GDDR6 included -- GDDR6.cpp puts the channel
         *     level inside the density product, so 8 Gb is the whole two-
         *     channel device). Ruling R1.
         *   HBM2/HBM3: ONE CORE DIE, which fronts TWO channels. NOT the
         *     preset's per-channel density (HBM2.cpp/HBM3.cpp call it "channel
         *     density") and not the stack. This is the unit the die-area path
         *     needs -- HBM2's 1024 MB is the 8 Gb Sohn ISSCC-2016 core die
         *     exactly, which is why HBM2's 96.00 mm^2/die lands on its
         *     published anchor -- and it is deliberately NOT the unit its
         *     partner chips_per_rank counts (that is the CHANNEL count, 8/16).
         *     Ruling R2.

     * it is NOT the 1.11.56 speed-bin correction. That release moved
     * clock_freq_mhz, data_rate_mtps and tBurst_ns only, and said in each
     * factory that "the ns timings are absolute and stay" -- tRCD/tCAS/tRP for
     * HBM2 and HBM3 are byte-identical before and after it. The drift dates to
     * release 1.1.1, which raised HBM2 tRCD/tCAS from 12.5 to the JESD235C
     * spec minimum 16.0 and HBM3 tRCD/tCAS from 10.0 to the JESD238 spec
     * minimum 16.0, and did not move the two derived literals with them: 25.0
     * is 12.5+12.5 and 37.5 is 3 x 12.5, HBM2's pre-1.1.1 arithmetic exactly,
     * and 20.0/30.0 is HBM3's. They were consistent when written and have been
     * inconsistent for every release since.
     *
     * Fix (a) of the two the audit offered -- computed, not corrected-plus-
     * checked -- because nothing needs these two settable independently of the
     * timings. The one path that writes them from outside a factory
     * (extractDRAMArchitecture / updateDRAMArchitectureFromRamulator in

     * only definition either path ever used; the literals were a second
     * authority that agreed by accident.

     * on every HBM3 run so the disagreement could not be missed, leaving the
     * choice of which authority moves to a ruling of its own. Unlike HBM2
     * there is no measured anchor here that could arbitrate:
     * vendorDieDensity()'s HBM3 row is a density (0.16 Gb/mm^2, SemiAnalysis),
     * not a die capacity.
     *
     * THE RULING (R6, user, 2026-08-24): PIMID relies on the Ramulator models,
     * those models are calibrated to JEDEC and the vendor data in misc/, and
     * PIMID ITSELF PROVIDES NO NUMBERS -- so a PIMID-side literal that
     * paraphrases a preset must be DERIVED from it. The wrapper literal has no
     * standing; the object follows the preset. On the core-die unit R2 fixed,
     * the preset implies 2 channels x 4 Gb = 8 Gb = 1024 MB per core die, and
     * 1024 x 8 dies = 8 GiB per stack -- the preset's stack exactly.
     *
     * WHAT MOVES: the reported DRAM die area HALVES, 100.00 -> 50.00 mm^2/die,
     * and the memory total 800 -> 400 mm^2 (the die-area path is linear in
     * chip_size_mb because the JEDEC calibration cancels the raw CACTI run).
     * capacity_ in the wrapper rises 4 -> 8 GiB, being derived from the same
     * preset. The capacity cross-check now RECONCILES on HBM3, so a firing
     * there is a real error again and not an expected note.
     *
     * The value is not written here as a literal either: applyPresetDensity-
     * ToArchitecture() derives it, and this line is the check. */
