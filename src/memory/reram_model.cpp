/* 1.11.57 (latent D044): THE MISSING ACCESS SIZE.
 *
 * read_energy_/write_energy_ HELD pJ PER BYTE when this was written --

 * ReRAMArchitecture::energy.read_energy_per_byte
 * / write_energy_per_byte, which the extractor computes as a bank energy
 * divided by (word_width_bits / 8) (architecture_extractor.h).
 * getTotalEnergy() and printStats() multiplied that energy DENSITY by an
 * ACCESS COUNT and printed the product as "pJ", understating the dynamic
 * energy by exactly the access size in bytes -- 8x at this model's 64-bit
 * default.
 *
 * The consumers want per-access energy, so the arithmetic multiplies the
 * density back by the same bytes-per-access the extractor divided by, which
 * recovers the bank energy exactly instead of approximating it. The width must
 * come from access_width_bits_ for that identity to hold, since
 * initializeNVSim() is what hands it to NVSim; "0 = model default" is the
 * 64 bits initializeNVSim() substitutes.
 *
 * analog_compute_energy_ is NOT touched: it is pJ PER OPERATION
 * (energy.analog_compute_energy_pJ), so multiplying it by an op count was
 * already dimensionally right. Only the two per-byte densities were wrong.
 *
 * WHY IT WAS INVISIBLE: getTotalEnergy() and printStats() have no reachable
 * caller, and access() -- the only thing that increments the counters -- is
 * never called either, so the product was 0 * wrong.
 *
 * NOT FIXED HERE, deliberately: the leakage term adds JOULES (W x s) to a
 * picojoule sum, and getTotalEnergy() returns picojoules where MemoryModel
 * documents nanojoules. Those are audit D022 and D043; they span all five
 * plugin models and memory_model.h requires them to be one gated change. */
