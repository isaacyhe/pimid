 */
/* 1.11.57 (latent D044): THE MISSING ACCESS SIZE.
 *
 * read_energy_/write_energy_ HELD pJ PER BYTE when this was written -- the
 * model's own printout said so ("pJ/byte", initialize()), and the value came
 * from
 * STTMRAMArchitecture::energy.read_energy_per_byte, which the extractor
 * computes as bank_read_energy_pJ / (word_width_bits / 8)
 * (architecture_extractor.h). getTotalEnergy() and printStats() multiplied
 * that energy DENSITY by an ACCESS COUNT and printed the product as "pJ",
 * which understates the dynamic energy by exactly the access size in bytes: 8x
 * at this model's 64-bit default, 64x at the 512-bit width main.cpp asks the
 * SRAM path for.
 *
 * The consumers want per-access energy, so the arithmetic multiplies the
 * density back by the same bytes-per-access the extractor divided by -- which
 * recovers bank_read_energy_pJ exactly, rather than approximating it. The
 * width has to be read from access_width_bits_ for that identity to hold,
 * because initializeNVSim() is what feeds it to NVSim in the first place; the
 * "0 = model default" case is the 64 bits initializeNVSim() substitutes.
 *
 * WHY IT WAS INVISIBLE: getTotalEnergy() and printStats() have no reachable
 * caller on these models, and the counters they multiply are never incremented
 * because access() is never called either -- the product was 0 * wrong.
 *
 * NOT FIXED HERE, and deliberately: the leakage term below adds JOULES
 * (W x s) to a picojoule sum, and getTotalEnergy() returns picojoules where
 * MemoryModel documents nanojoules. Those are audit D022 and D043, they span
 * all five plugin models, and memory_model.h says in as many words that the
 * unit conversion must be one gated change rather than a rider on a
 * latent-defect pass. */
